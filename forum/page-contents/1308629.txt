 So last night I discovered a weird noise coming from my computer. After getting on the floor and listening to it, I deduced that the PSU was the source of the noise. The noise is a sizzle or crackle and I'm not sure what the cause is. It doesn't sound like coil whine or a wire hitting the fan; it sounds more like there's some electrical arc (maybe? I'm not sure). The sound itself isn't very consistent as it will go for a second or two, then stop for half of a second, then start again. I don't know how else to describe the problem. Is it a problem? I plan on calling EVGA about it but I have classes so I can't until later. This is the second unit they've provided me with; the first one crapped out after just 10 days of use, which they gladly replaced with the one I currently have.
  Specs:
PSU: EVGA 600 Watt 80+Bronze
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600
Motherboard: ASUS Prime B550-A (Wi-Fi)
Graphics Card: XFX RX 580 XXX (factory overclocked card)
Memory: G. Skill Ripjaw-V 2x8GB DDR4
Storage: Western Digital 500 GB M.2 NVME SSD
Case: Cooler Master MasterBox MB320L ARGB Micro-ATX with Dual ARGB Fans

 Yep. Get a new one ASAP. Don't deal with a risky PSU.

Do you think it could be the unit itself or am I using the wrong PSU? Would you advise getting a different model?

EVGA is usually a pretty reliable company. It could be the unit, but you said this is your second of this model, so you might've just been really unlucky.

It's probably just that you are super unlucky with this particular model. Generally I have a pretty good experience with EVGA, and this PSU should be totally fine coping with what you have. How long have you had the 2nd unit for?

Wow... That's real concerning... Maybe swap for a different PSU altogether...

Yeah... I'm gonna ask about that when I call EVGA. Thanks for the help, though!

  Which "EVGA 600 Watt 80+Bronze" do you have?
EVGA lists three different 80 PLUS Bronze 600W PSUs on their site.

Unfortunately this doesn't dictate how good their products are. Arguably most of EVGA's PSUs are either eh or shit.

  Here's the amazon link for the one I bought.
EVGA also suggested getting a 700-750 watt PSU after I told the guy what's in my system so I went with this one:
