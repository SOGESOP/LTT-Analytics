The original was good too, but I like this version better. It's easier to hear the choir. And remember, that's a bunch of Japanese people singing in German. LOL

Seems to be part of a much different music industry. The original sample song is actually quite ok too, the lass' vocals and beat being good and the dude that's rapping or whatever being goddamn awful.   it's becoming increasingly more apparent Youtube doesn't have at least half of the stuff I look for or want to post, unfortunately there are no other depositories. I'd do it myself, but Youtube requires a damned video to upload and not just an audio track.

It doesn't even sound german imo.

 COMMENT_BREAK Well of course I'm going to post more than one because music is like crack to me but, the one that I was listening to when I opened this thread is below, nice jazzy smoothness with a good few BPM that I'm enjoying with my porridge (just woke up).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ZNIWE68lg    OK now a couple more for the hell of it, I'll be listening to these in a minute anyway.  This is a remix that popped up in my sub box and I found it catchy enough to Like.  This is an ear stroker, so nice. If you're into guitar you've probably got him (or should get him) in your sub box anyway.  If this doesn't make you want to move at least one part of your body then you need electroconvulsive anal probing

Schoolboy by himself is pretty decent.   Gems like these and southern style cut with subtle electronic are pretty tough to find.  It just doesn't really seem to exist from a quantifiable source.   and not that trap music nonsense where most sucks and sounds like a bastardization by children that like brostep and hippop.   currently mining for more stuff like that and hardcore/breakcore +bastard stuff

For the good part, check out his 'Liked videos', that's a pretty good tip in general actually, if I find a track I like on one of the millions of promo channels then I always try to see if the artist has a home channel (often hardly any subs/views) and then stalk their likes for more stuff on their wavelength.
