Yeah. The Night Core remixes are kinda good. 
The original was good too, but I like this version better. It's easier to hear the choir. And remember, that's a bunch of Japanese people singing in German. LOL

    trying to dig around for more stuff similar to this, really difficult to find. Seems to be part of a much different music industry. The original sample song is actually quite ok too, the lass' vocals and beat being good and the dude that's rapping or whatever being goddamn awful. 
  it's becoming increasingly more apparent Youtube doesn't have at least half of the stuff I look for or want to post, unfortunately there are no other depositories. I'd do it myself, but Youtube requires a damned video to upload and not just an audio track.

I meant the specific song.
  It's called Fever (mix of Peggy Lee song) and that seems to be the only hit aside from the original source.

True, no idea what they are singing... It doesn't even sound german imo.

 Well of course I'm going to post more than one because music is like crack to me but, the one that I was listening to when I opened this thread is below, nice jazzy smoothness with a good few BPM that I'm enjoying with my porridge (just woke up).
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ZNIWE68lg
    OK now a couple more for the hell of it, I'll be listening to these in a minute anyway.
  This is a remix that popped up in my sub box and I found it catchy enough to Like.
  This is an ear stroker, so nice. If you're into guitar you've probably got him (or should get him) in your sub box anyway.
  If this doesn't make you want to move at least one part of your body then you need electroconvulsive anal probing
