From a quick glance, the main difference pertains to how the rules are displayed (didn't check if there are additions/retractions/changes); the new one is more clearly divided (section for general conduct, section for piracy, section for spam, etc.)
  My guess is it's more of a "clean up" of the old rules; easier for members to read & easier for mods/admins to edit.
 I've unhidden @Spotty's summary of the changes a couple of posts up. There are no changes here in what we will be enforcing, just making our current policies more explicit.

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files,
git diff basically shows the changes that you make to files when using git.

I'm wondering if that's a hard rule, or if some exceptions are ok.
I remember a xeon phi thread where we discussed about it and also linked some ongoing ebay listings in case one wanted to grab one, would this be ok or a no-no according to those rules?

I understand though it is impossible to be sure if the person asking has forgotten their password or just stole a laptop.
I don't know what criteria said post would have to meet in order to be classified as genuine help vs malicious act, or the likes.
  I guess that would be up to the mods to decide on a case by case bases.

Yes, this would be to circumnavigate restrictions that are in place on the device. Its not our fault/problem if someone forgot there password. Since it is done over the internet and we have no way of verifying that it is accurate, we err on the side of caution and proceed as if this is trying to get around restrictions or something more nefarious.

That rule was already in place for last edition. As with others, it's looked on case-by-case. If there's something with linking that makes it look like advertising personal listing or it's done to harass seller, then it's not ok. But if its done by giving examples within subject of discussion, its usually fine.
 Could a line or two on what you can put for your member title be added if it’s not there already? I didn’t see one.

There are no specific rules for member titles, because it's not something that's been problematic in the past. As long as it complies with the general rules, it's probably fine.

Question implies that you are trying to use profanity, ad or politics. Which are all already been ruled out.

No, it hasn't. The old topic is still visible, and has never been hidden.

Correct, you're going to have to remove that. This rule has been the same for a long time.

sure, i'll remove it
but can i know why though, but it's fine if it's a "just because"

Because the rules used to be that we don't allow any external links at all, to cut down on advertising etc (and because we don't want moderators to need to visit all the links in people's signatures to check if they're ok). We have since added a couple of common exceptions that are definitely safe, but there's not much reason to make that list much bigger given that things can be added to profiles too.
 Ok so basically just a reformat. Nice.

    that is not even the old version of CS, that is the predecessor for CS in the first place
