  The following is not an exhaustive list of the rules and guidelines that must be followed when participating on Linus Tech Tips. The rules outlined below are only the minimum expectations of members and not every issue can be predicted and addressed here, so conduct could still be considered out of line even if it isn't explicitly covered here.

From a quick glance, the main difference pertains to how the rules are displayed (didn't check if there are additions/retractions/changes); the new one is more clearly divided (section for general conduct, section for piracy, section for spam, etc.)
  My guess is it's more of a "clean up" of the old rules; easier for members to read & easier for mods/admins to edit.

Yes, this would be to circumnavigate restrictions that are in place on the device. Its not our fault/problem if someone forgot there password. Since it is done over the internet and we have no way of verifying that it is accurate, we err on the side of caution and proceed as if this is trying to get around restrictions or something more nefarious.

That rule was already in place for last edition. As with others, it's looked on case-by-case. If there's something with linking that makes it look like advertising personal listing or it's done to harass seller, then it's not ok. But if its done by giving examples within subject of discussion, its usually fine.

There are no specific rules for member titles, because it's not something that's been problematic in the past. As long as it complies with the general rules, it's probably fine.

Because the rules used to be that we don't allow any external links at all, to cut down on advertising etc (and because we don't want moderators to need to visit all the links in people's signatures to check if they're ok). We have since added a couple of common exceptions that are definitely safe, but there's not much reason to make that list much bigger given that things can be added to profiles too.

 To clarify, how far is mentioning something before it's advertising? I'd assume mentioning something like a program as a recent project you're working on is fine, but actively mentioning it anywhere and everywhere it could be applicable is not.

We allow sharing personal projects as long as there's no profit motive, its hosted on neutral platform (eg. Github) etc. Ofc, like with all of these, context matters. If you are actively looking for threads that are after something that you can provide, that crosses to guerilla advertising.

If I'm reading this correctly, you are saying some thread has been ignored by moderation. I would like to point out that rules are just written guidelines. It still requires user input to notify staff about the brewing misconduct. So do please report anything that might be against the rules. Moderation will take a look, and inform you if the issues are within rules. Or acts to keep things within the rules.

To spring board off this: Moderators are only as effective as their community. A healthy community that reports issues gives the Moderation team ability to resolve them. We cant fix things we aern't aware of. 
  I'd estimate 9/10 reports we get are community based and the other 1/10 are ones moderation finds on their own.

We've slightly tweaked the wording of the rule to hopefully clarify this - the problem is promoting your own listings rather than just referencing other people's.

 Hi, I have a quick rules question that I couldn't find an answer to anywhere. The company I work for is currently hiring, and I was curious if we could post the position here on LTT. Without going into too much detail, it's an IT position in the gaming industry, so naturally LTT came to mind immediately when I was asked to help find someone.

Would this be allowed? If so, please let me know what forum would be most appropriate for it and/or if there's anything you'd like from us in terms of making sure we're legit or reviewing the post before it goes up.

There has not been discussion on that. So falls down to same category with emulation, jailbreaking, hackintoshes and youtube downloaders. Until there comes harsher ruling.
  So in that sense, it also falls down to what Linus does on other platforms doesn't always directly effect forums. Be it talking about politics/taking stance on something or endorsing devices that include pirated stuff.
  And, you can whitelist sites with adblocks. So you choose to block ads on sites that fund content creation.

 Do community guidelines apply to content posted or linked by LTT?
I feel like if a member made a thread about jailbreaking a device and included links to an outside site instructing how to do it that would probably fall under the bypassing device security/restrictions and be culled, no? The LTT video posted includes a link to the channel who's videos have links to websites that I'm fairly certain would not be permitted to be directly linked on the forums. Are degrees of separation what make this kind of gray area permissible?

LMG videos are not held to the same guidelines as other content on the forum, because LMG make their own judgements on ethical grey areas that are harder to enforce across the whole site (for example, we want to avoid receiving takedown notices from companies, and that risk can only really be judged on a case-by-base basis).
  Jailbreaking is definitely on the less clear end of the spectrum here - the main purpose of that rule is to stop people from saying "how do I bypass this school web filter" and stuff like that. While LMG would still be allowed to post a topic about a video about how to bypass school web filters, the expectation is that they won't make videos about that because they are aligned with us on what content is ok.

I just took a look at it,It is 100% piracy.
The website may present it in a way that makes it look innocent but the bottom line is that they let you download and launch a paid game of someone else without paying a cent.
  I recommend censoring the name of the launcher since it can be used to download it (fact is i found it because the name was mentioned).
It's like someone is mentioning the name of a piracy website instead of a link,but the end result is that both lead to the same web page.

Once a day for active subforums. Though if you aren't getting replies, think also if you need to change something in your post to be more clear etc.

Thanks for clarifying~
I think it might be due to me sharing too much detail (long post) hahah. I'll try to update with a TL;DR instead

 Rule update: Posts generated by AI (such as ChatGPT) are now explicitly prohibited (they were previously a grey area). Our experience of these posts so far is that they are low quality and do not contribute much to the discussion. If you wish, you can still use ChatGPT to research your post, but you must restate the answer in your own words, and ensure that it is useful and relevant to the topic at hand.

 Can we also get a rule against sensationalist headlines in the Tech news subforum? It's kinda getting tiring

Subforum specific rules are covered by pinned topics in the subforum. The Tech News Posting Guidelines already covers misleading or clickbait titles.
  Quote
The title of your thread must be relevant to the topic and should give a reader a good idea of the contents of the thread. Copying the title of the source is permitted but absolutely not required. It should be to the point and not be done in such a way as to mislead a reader, such as clickbait, etc.
  If posts do not meet subforum specific guidelines you can report the post with the "Doesn't meet subforum posting guidelines" reason.

Given how many moderators frequently visit the Tech News subforum, I'd welcome a periodic automatic scan without us reporting topics in question, and additionally a bit stricter rules what is considered clickbait. As @Lightwreather JfromN pointed out, it's getting ridiculous in what ways people sensationalize and/or misrepresent very minor developments to make clickworthy TN threads out of them.

Things like sensationalism can be difficult at times to judge objectively, so those issues do tend to need some discussion internally before taking action. It can help to make a decision more quickly if there is also user feedback that aligns with the moderator's judgement, to validate that it is a real issue.

Bypassing security features, restrictions, or filters (including parental filters, school restrictions, or workplace monitoring), including on your own device.
Can I ask why this is a huge deal? What if I want to learn to flash or jailbreak an iPhone/android device? Does this also apply to countries that filter content? 
  Sorry if I sound rude, I am just curious lol

Its because of a few reasons. A: We can't verify your identity and that you actually are the owner of the device. B: If a device is stolen/lost and someone "Acquires" said device, its theft. C: A lot of people are looking to bypass firewalls and rules put in place by schools, work, etc to view content that they're not permitted to on that network in question. Im sure I am missing others, but these are just a few reasons we won't help in hacking/bypassing security rules and filters.

Jailbreaks are fine. It's falls under hackintosh/emulator discussion. It's not something even Apple cares about anymore.

 Are we allowed to offer to buy//resell someone a LMG product over the forums? (e.g. building them a custom screwdriver at LTX then reselling it to them, after meeting and talking on the forum.

Classifieds rules apply. Your example would be no, since it's service, not a product. Selling essentially used LMG merch is same as selling anything else. You need 100 posts to qualify and must follow subforum rules.

 I think that this new set of Comunity standards and all of the new open sourced information 
is an amazing aproach for the future of LTT

The re-write OF CS was iniated by moderation and executed by moderation. It was done way before current drama and mainly to clear some of the more commonly disputed decisions. Core principles have remained same since forums were created.

 No AI generated posts I understand, 
  But can we talk about AI text generation, prompts and asking for feedback on AI-generated content? 
  E.G. Hey guys, I'm trying to work out the best prompt for *this task* So far here is my prompt *prompt* and I got *output* 
  Any ideas on how to improve this

I think line is quite clear. If you have bot write posts for you, then its not you posting. If you want to ask advice on using/utilizing AI, developing things or discuss about things made by/with AI, those are all allowed already. Things made by AI mainly in Off Topic.
  No AI made posts is same as posting just google search. If you search Google, post your interpretaation of results, thats already more/better content. Same applies to AI. If you get answers by AI, you can still use them as long as its you using it as reference or source.
