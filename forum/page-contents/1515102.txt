 Overall, technology is great, in my opinion. But there are some things I just don't like how they are going.
  I want my headphone jack!
Take the deletion of the headphone jack for an example. Now I had to get a Bluetooth to FM transmitter in order to hook up my wife's new Pixel phone to the car stereo, inspite of the car having an AUX port. I guess I could get a type C to headphone jack adapter, but then she charges her phone mostly in the car. The car, a 2013 Toyota Avalon, also has Bluetooth but it has stopped working, twice. About a year after taking it to a dealer and spending hundreds to get it fixed it stopped working again. This kind of stuff just leaves a bad taste in my mouth for newer technology.
  Bluetooth hates me!
Bluetooth usually doesn't work for me. Not only does it not work in the car, I also went and bought my first bluetooth headphones and am also having problems with them too. Yes I got some cheap ones, a brand called PowerLocus, but I got them because of another thing. My current phone, the Pixel 4a, doesn't have FM radio. I bought these headphones because they also have an FM tuner in them, which works ok for listening to FM radio (sometimes I have to angle my head just right at work to get the signal).
  Why have wireless if I need to wire them to my body anyway?!
Personally I prefer earphones (AKA earbuds) instead of headphones. Between me forgeting to plug in and charge my PowerLocus FM headphones and also not having an easy way to carry them around when not in use I end up just using my trusty Skull Candy wired earphones instead (at least my own phone has a headphone jack). Taking note of this, my mom got me some Beats wireless earphones as a present, but they need a lightning cable to charge, which I had to go buy one, and they fall off my ears. At least the Skull Candy ones are wired and therefore tethered to me. I don't see the point of using wireless earphones that I need to tie a string to so I can tie them to some part of my body anyway.
  Where am I supposed to watch movies or get my music?!
I'm just not into some of these subscription services. Maybe I haven't tried enough of them, but the ones I've tried I just haven't liked. Netflix is horrible. When we first got it there were several movies we really liked. They are not on Netflix anymore and trying to find something to watch that we like on there is very hard. We've tied Hulu as well. I think we have better luck with good ol' free ATSC TV than trying to figure out what's subscription services have the movies and shows we like. The same with Music. I can't figure out Pandora, and while Apple Music is kind of nice they still don't have everything I'm looking for. I just don't feel I have the time to keep trying out subscription services that I feel probably won't be worth it in the end anyway. So I just listen to less music and watch fewer movies than ever before. Maybe this is a good thing.
  I hate digital downloads and game subscriptions!
This whole subcription plan thing also pushes me away from wanting to get any newer console like a Switch. I can't get any online content on my Wii anymore. So Instead of buying newer consoles I put together a MiSTer and bought some old cartidges and CDs and prefer playing that instead of having to think about what subscriptions on what consoles get me the games we like to play and wondering how much longer those particular consoles and games will be supported.
  Why can't they figure out a TV that looks good (to me)?!
That and I don't like how a lot of games look and feel on modern TV's. I've played some NES and SNES games on a couple of Switches that belong to friends, but I feel like something is messed up. When I go back home and drag out the ol' SNES and CRT I feel like it's almost an entirely different game. The controls feel responsive and the graphics look better IMO. I do find the MiSTer seems to do much better than the Switch in this regard. Maybe it's the Switch's controls, since I use original OEM controls via a low-latency USB adapter to use on the MiSTer. But having more options on the MiSTer to try to make the image look more like an actual CRT is a dream come true! I'm saving my pennies for a Retrotink 5x so I can have similar filters on my other retro consoles. If they put these options on a Switch I'd be more interested in one. But also a TV that had the option to look more CRTish would be great too. I find LCD screens to blur more when things are in motion and on mine the blacks seem to glow really badly. I've never seen an OLED in person, so maybe that would be a good TV, but I don't think I could afford one and am fearful of burning in.
  Am I too old fashioned?
Maybe I'm just too old fashioned. Part of the reason I don't get into newer tech is I'm not that interested in newer songs, movies or videogames. Which is weird. I love the NES, the SNES, the N64 and the Gamecube! The Wii is ok, but I never felt the urge to buy a WiiU or a Switch. I can't figure it quite out, but playing at other people's homes on their consoles, games like Mario Odyessy and Breath of the Wild for some reason don't appeal to me even though I've always been a Mario and Zelda fan. I'm not sure what it is about these games that I don't like, but I just don't. The only reason I would want a Switch right now is to play Metroid Dread, and buying a whole console to play just one game just doesn't make sense. I mean, I absolutely love Link's Awakening, but I don't like the 3D graphics on the new Switch version. Why? I don't know, I guess it's just me, but my better half has similar opinions. So I guess it's just us.
  Other stuff.
And we haven't even gotten into other things like cars. I don't like touch screens, generally speaking, especially in cars. I miss my manual transmission and funny car sounds. I feel like manufacturers try to sell new cars like some sort of fun and entertaining object that should make you look cool to your friends. But to me, a lot of old cars are cool. New cars are just practical means of moving from point A to point B. I miss my 1952 Plymouth Cranbrook, my 1972 VW Super Beetle, my 1985 VW Golf non-turbo diesel and my 1993 Mazda 323. But oh well, I'll probably get whatever's the cheapest to own when my current car is too expensive to repair, with a slight bias towards an EV for a few different reasons if not too expensive, just so I can have a way to get from point A to point B when walking or biking don't make sense.
  Do you agree or disagree? Is there something in tech you don't like the way it's headed?
 COMMENT_BREAK
 Some interesting takes. Generally I like the way tech is going, but there's always growing pains. For example it'll probably be another 5 years before wireless earbuds have the same sound quality as their wired counterpart. Phones are insane compared to what they were when I first got one, and they're only improving; I can't wait until it replaces my tablet. I haven't had to carry a camera around in years, and that's only getting more and more true. Portable storage is super cheap. Google Assistant can play whatever I want in the car via Spotify.
  I think you're just adverse to change. Which isn't uncommon, but definitely something that's going to leave you stuck, bitter and annoyed for the rest of your life.
    On your points:
Cheap bluetooth is a bad time. I've had it, it's not great. It's not all created equal.
I don't miss the headphone jack, but I also don't listen to music on my phone.
Your mom has a specific set of earbuds that has a connecting cable. That's a choice, it's not a requirement You don't have to have wires at all.
You can buy movies, often very affordably, online if you want to watch them. This is the same as going to the store and renting would have been back in the day. Nothing has really changed other than the delivery method. Not liking what's on the platforms seems like a personal problem, not really a problem with the service.
As for game subs, if you mean the Game Pass on Xbox, I think it's brilliant...as long as there's at least 2 games a year you'd want to play on it. The value is insane. I personally don't use it as there's only a few games that I like, and I just pay the $80 for them when they're released.
The older systems aren't designed around the same technology, so it won't look the same. I can't remember why it is, but there is a reason for it. It's not that your TV doesn't look good, they look the best they ever have; you're just trying to use something that's not made to be used with it. My dad recently got a PS5, and it looks stunning on his 75" 4k TV.

Ya, me too. I find carrying around a phone, tablet and laptop and still owning a desktop to be a bit overkill, yet necessary at the same time. Of course when I did have a film camera cellphones, tablets and laptops weren't a thing yet. Actually most people didn't even own even a desktop at the time.

One thing I loved about DVD's was the language selection. English isn't our family's first language. Like I say, I probably should look around more, but other than Netflix and Disney Plus, it seems everywhere else has gone back to the VHS days when you could only buy or rent movies in only one language, which is English when I've done so on Amazon and Youtube, unless it's a certain specific foreign movie that we're probably not interested in. We still buy and watch mostly DVD's as a result.

You should still have the option for both though. I do not see the need to force one, or the other in most cases.
I think this is a good point. Keep the option there until it's plainly obvious that the newer method is superior in most, if not all aspects.

Things I think you might be a little off base with
SUBSCRIPTION MEDIA - When I was a kid you could sign up for music subscriptions and they would send you an LP or cassette a month, and if you paid more, you got more albums in the same period. Some of them were full albums, some were that months "hot chart topper singles". This is nothing new, and has been an option for my entire life. Lots of people did it. There were Book and Film of the Month clubs! There were sewing catalogs that would mail you new templates and fashions every month for you to work on. Old computrer magazines and clubs sent you new programs and games well into the early 2000's with sample code for you to program into your computer ( in ye olde days), or with demo discs and even sometimes full games (this is how ID software got started to make this relevant).

Very interesting. Although I can say that there have been a few digital licenses I've bought in the past that I can no longer use because the company is gone or no longer offers the download.

All touch screen with no feeling or physical back up is bad, but this is a implementation issue and not an actual issue with the tech itself.
My issue in a car is trying to use it while driving. As a bus driver I remember when they went to push button shifters. I can't tell you how many times I've hit neutral or reverse when trying to down shift or up shift for engine braking. At least on the car hitting the A/C button instead of the heater button isn't as nerve racking. But I must be really old if I can brag about being able to flawlessly double clutch a non-synchronized manual transmission yet can't seem to get a push button automatic to change to the appropiate gear.

Lol, another comment that can be said of 70-80 year old tech! My grandfather had a 57 DeSoto...It was push button gear select and it was awesome. If its vacuum based like this, the solenoids are not powerful enough to drop to reverse or are even fully locked out. Even modern manual cars gate the reverse with a lock out plate.
Expand  
At least that had protruding physical buttons, only three speeds, the buttons were shaped differently one from the other and it wasn't the norm as there were other options. Trying to hit Allison transmission buttons in a bouncing bus driver's seat I think is still harder:
Anywho, a lot of things were available decades ago. But today, some of those things are becoming the standard accross all vehicles. What new car doesn't have a touchscreen? As an amateur radio operator I find it hard to figure out where and how to integrate my mobile radio as car companies make it so you can't modify the stereo system like on older vehicles and the infotainment system and center console time take up way too much space.

  I want my headphone jack!
I've only encountered this as a problem 1 time since iPhone 7 began removed the port. I was on a 16hr flight recently and I brought my current-gen iPad Pro. I bought my wired headphones, and I even brought the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter. Motherf$#@ing iPad has no headphone jack and used USB-C!!

Other than that, my car has a headphone jack, and a USB-A port. When I want to listen to music on my phone, I always have the lightning adapter in my backpack, or I'll use my separate mp3 player. Plus I have bluetooth headphones - both AirPods and 3rd party. Never any problems.
  Bluetooth hates me!
Genuinely have never had a problem with this, between many budget and many expensive Bluetooth options. I don't understand what other people are doing.
  Where am I supposed to watch movies or get my music?!
I don't understand. This situation has barely changed.
  Television? Live television still exists. DVDs and Blu-ray still exists. I don't understand people who complain about Netflix, Hulu, etc selections. They are filled with many thousands of hours of content. Just because the 5 seconds you spend reading the synopsis and looking at the promotion image looks uninteresting, it doesn't meant it's not good.
Movies? Literally the same situation. DVDs. Blu-ray. iTunes rental/purchase. Amazon rental/purchase.
Music?  Seriously dude? We're in the golden age of accessing any music we ever want. You want to own the music? Then use iTunes, Amazon, Bandcamp, etc. Go to your local Target or Newbury comics and buy some CDs or Vinyl records.
  Why can't they figure out a TV that looks good (to me)?!
You have a really niche issue... and it's also solvable with emulators and ROMs.
  Am I too old fashioned?
It just seems like you're old-fashioned in all of the "old man yells at cloud" ways. Many things can still be done the old-fashioned way...
Music, film, TV, and video games are all a product of their time, and you also have the massive benefits of hindsight. We love to talk about how "things aren't as good as they use to be" but that's only because we filtered out all of the garbage and only talk about the good stuff. Quantitatively there was also so much less of everything back then. Nowadays there's just TOO MUCH of everything, and it's becoming harder to find the gems, but that doesn't mean those gems don't exist.

I really liked iTunes for watching movies until every movie I've purchased or rented from them will not show. I've talked about this several times with Apple to no avail, but their Windows app just won't work for me, and I'm running a 12th gen Intel Core i5 desktop, so I have no idea what is going on or why it won't work.
  I can listen to iTunes music on my phone if I have Apple Music on the phone (Pixel 4a). But I believe I also need a subscription in order to have Apple Music. Maybe I'll get that subscription. It just seems overpriced for just one person and I can't convince my wife to use it. It is nice being able to download the music I like as a lot of places I drive does not have good cell reception for streaming.

True. Nothing is all bad nor all good and it's easy to twist things one way or another by pointing out all the bad or all the good and not the other.

That sums it up right there!
  Also having the time for all the good stuff is also a challenge. For an example, I think the reason I'm not that interested in some Nintendo Switch games is I haven't finished all the previous games of the series. I've just started Mario 64, have wanted to play Super Mario Sunshine for years and so don't see the point of jumping to Super Mario Odyssey right now.

I replaced a couple old hi-fi floor speakers and a flaky Yamaha 5.1 receiver with a sound bar/sub combo, for a few reasons:
  - The controls on the receiver were janky, so I rarely used it.
- The setup was capable of getting way too loud for my relatively small living room.
- I needed to add at least three more speakers if I wanted full surround.
- Those speakers were huge, with a 2", 4", and 12" driver in each one. They're between the size of an end table and a mini-fridge.
  The sound bar I settled on is a Samsung T650. It sounds fine (though maybe a little lacking in the high end), I've got a rear speaker kit coming, and I've already used it a lot more than the old setup because it "just works". I just had to add an RCA switch box, Insignia digital tuner, and an analog to SPDIF encoder to get back to feature parity, but I also gained HDMI ARC, HD Radio tuning, and built-in Bluetooth.
  If I had an amp that worked properly that I could also program into my Logitech Harmony remote, I might have gone with bookshelf speakers and a dedicated sub.

I hate that I need to choose between charging my phone or listening to music when my earbuds are dead. I also hate that for some reason with my new S23+ phone doesn't allow me to use my cheap earbuds, they just don't work with the supplied USB C to mini jack plug for most likely software reasons (it works on my old phone just fine).
The phone itself is not even thin enough to claim that it was to make the phone thinner either.

In another thread I was trying to figure out how to do the 3-2-1 rule with the stuff Microsoft ships with Windows 10 and 11. But Microsoft has made it to where you can either backup to the cloud (OneDrive) or to a second hard drive (Backup and Restore or File History) but you can't do both. Microsoft has attempted to make it impossible to do this making you choose either backups to the cloud or backups to the second hard drive but not both. Why?!
  I got a copy of SyncToy (which Microsoft no longer offers) and was able to backup my OneDrive folder with that.

  It would be great to have a world where we used everything for good and didn't have dilemas forcing us to choose our evil.
  I went without a smartphone all last year. It was great in some aspects but not that great in others. I came to a somewhat happy medium by getting a smartphone and putting parental controls on it that lock out everything I don't really want to have with me everywhere I go, regardless of how much I like them or how much others think I should have access to them all the time. I do not have access to YouTube, Floatplane or any other video service on my phone. The same with search engines, social media, and forums like this site. If I want to watch a Linus Tech Tips video, for an example, I have to come home and turn on the desktop to see it. That way, if I need to use my bank app or maps while I'm out and about, I still can. But anything else that could be left for when I get home has to be left for when I get home.

 I second the headphone jack problem, but its also avoidable, but the trend is there. Every phone i own has one, so its not the worst.
  My bigger problem is, that its pretty much impossible to get a small laptop that it rugged, but not as rugged (and expensive) as the toughbook, has a lot of replaceable parts, a RJ45 jack etc... Almost every small laptop is a macbook air copy. Nothing is replaceable, the battery is glued in etc... The best one i found so far, is the Framework. But its not exactly in the rugged category.
  I am very happy that the trend to totally non-repairable devices that have to be thrown away when they have the smallest problem and arent upgradeable at least gets reversed a little.
  The next big problem, i see, is that seemingly everything is now tied to a server that the manufacturer can switch off everyday they feel like it and then the device doesn`t work anymore or losses important features, although it technically could be used for many years to come.
  The last one is, that data security, for many manufacturers, seems to be an afterthought, if they think about it at all.
Its much more important to gather as much data about every living being as possible, if they need the data, or not.
  These  might not be an hardware issue per se, but every year it gets harder to find hardware that doesn`t come with software without these issues.

I think you're out of touch with the way console gaming is going. A lot of physical games aren't actually physical, but rather digital downloads in disguise. Or at least they need the internet in order to work. Take Gran Turismo 7 needing to be hooked up to the internet on a PlayStation 5 in order to work even though you're not playing against any other players. And companies, like Nintendo and Sony, have showed how they would rather kill off their old digital download libraries and not preserve anything until the decide to resell them to their fans.
  I have Atari 2600 games that still work. But at the rate things are going a person could buy a new console and dozens of "physical" games and 10 years from now won't be able to play a single one of them because they were, in reality, digital downloads that needed to be connected to a server that no longer exists.

CRT TV's are usually the only way to see interlaced video correctly, which some consoles, like the PS2, were designed to do primarely interlaced video.

yep, its the "holy grail" of CRT monitors as u may know : D

The monitor also has a maximum resolution of 2304x1440 at a refresh rate of 80 Hz—pretty good even by modern standards—and it can hit a super-smooth refresh rate of 160 Hz when the resolution is cut in half.

yeah, i don't watch TV, but when i did the last 10 years or so i was using my Asus MX279h (also still working  btw, but im using a 1440P MSI rn) and a satellite receiver and the picture was so much sharper and colors more accurate than any TV, especially at that price point.

Or at least they need the internet in order to work. Take Gran Turismo 7 needing to be hooked up to the internet on a PlayStation 5 in order to work even though you're not playing against any other players. And companies, like Nintendo and Sony, have showed how they would rather kill off their old digital download libraries and not preserve anything until the decide to resell them to their fans.

This is a large part of the reason I went to PC gaming, as the degree and flexibility of the platform allows me to take more control over my games, and guarantee access. Emulation of older console games, for example, and GoG provides executables directly. Physical media is hardly relevant when I have backups of executables and image files. In this case, my drives are the physical media.

The older systems aren't designed around the same technology, so it won't look the same. I can't remember why it is, but there is a reason for it. It's not that your TV doesn't look good, they look the best they ever have; you're just trying to use something that's not made to be used with it. My dad recently got a PS5, and it looks stunning on his 75" 4k TV.
SNES would draw to the CRT line by line, as CRT's effectively have an electron gun that sweeps across the screen.  There was still some delay, but overall the delay was pretty small and the frame is only as delayed as it takes to draw all the lines on the screen.
  Modern TV's expect essentially an image to display, not a line.
  For modern systems like Switch, when playing SNES games they use an emulator, which still then has to effectively emulate the same rendering line by line...so they usually have a buffer that they are storing the rendered image in and then when they reach the last line they have the image, in about the same timing as the original console did...but now they have to actually send it; which at that stage it means you send it to the TV which has latency.
  So in essence you are taking the original time it took to render and adding on the new modern latency of the TV (which usually don't have great refresh rates).
    My personal dislike, modern games using client based physics calculations on things like location.  I liked it better when the servers would also run the calculations preventing people from cheating as much.

When I was a kid you could sign up for music subscriptions and they would send you an LP or cassette a month, and if you paid more, you got more albums in the same period. Some of them were full albums, some were that months "hot chart topper singles".
Did you have to return them when you were done, or were they yours to keep? The main issue with subscription services to me is you never know if that movie you wanted to watch is still going to be there in a year. These days if there's something I know I want to watch in the future, I try and get a physical disk for that reason.

Movies? Literally the same situation. DVDs. Blu-ray. iTunes rental/purchase. Amazon rental/purchase.
DVDs and Blu-Ray are better than nothing for sure, but they are far from what I would consider to be a great solution. They have high bitrate which is good, and since I physically own them, I'm not worried about them disappearing over time. That said, they require special hardware to play and can't easily be watched anywhere, so it's an unfortunate tradeoff. Ripping them is possible but not very convenient since it requires special hardware and software, and even then doesn't always work, eg I recently had a show which I ripped but one of the audio tracks fails to transfer properly due to a bug in the ripping software (there's not much choice in ripping software given it's kind of a legal grey area depending on jurisdiction).
  Digital purchases like you mention (itunes/amazon) are more convenient than blu rays, but I'm not aware of any legal purchasing services that actually give you a full quality, drm-free download for movies (full quality meaning standard blu ray bitrate or better, not the awful bitrates they give you on all those streaming services). If you can't download it drm-free then you have similar issues as subscription services - if the company ever disappears or decides to pull out of that business segment, you'll lose access to it since they are the owners of the decryption keys. If you use hardware or operating system they don't approve of or support, you can't watch it. If you don't have internet access to verify their drm keys, you can't watch it. You don't own it.
  Interestingly, the music industry is in a pretty good place here in comparison to movies, there's quite a few sites you can legally purchase and download CD quality drm-free music from. If you can't find the digital purchase, buying a CD is a nice fallback option, a bit inconvenient to rip but much less so than blu ray since the CDs aren't encrypted like blu rays are.

Until last month you could just rent the disk from netflix still. Then Rip it.
True, but I don't think it would have been legal to keep those copies since the law allows for personal backup copies to be taken for personal use, but it's not a backup anymore if you don't own the original. Since you were only renting it, presumably at a discounted rate compared to buying it, I wouldn't consider that ethically equivalent to owning a copy and ripping it (not that I necessarily consider it ethically wrong, that's a different topic, just saying it's in an entirely different ethical category to begin with).

the short of all this is, even if you own the disk... you dont own it.
True, if it's drm, it's not yours. That said, if you go through the hoops to rip it, it can be yours, even if it's a legal grey area. The hoops for ripping a blu ray are generally much more practical than the hoops required to decrypt a drm-protected digital download that you purchased.

The alternatives are forced. Regardless of anyone's opinion about Apple, if someone prefers iOS over Android for whatever reasons, they're stuck with using a Lightning to headphone jack adapter if they want to use earphones with a 3.5mm jack.
  The trend is towards removal of it, and it will just keep getting worse unless there's stronger pushback.

 There is one smartphone my phone provider provides that has FM radio, and a lot of people say "don't ever get that phone" for many other reasons. Yes, there are alternatives: 1) an older phone with FM radio, 2) a separate device that has FM radio that you'll also have to stuff in your pocket, 3) an app that lets you listen to whatever FM stations are also on the internet. But all those have a lot of disadvantages compared to phones 10 years ago, when the latest Samsung Galaxy S series phones even had headphone jacks and FM radio.
  And the situation is similar with the headphone jack. For an example, the phone companies that will update their phones for the next 5 years from launch are Apple, Samsung (with their Galaxy S series) and Google, but none of those phones offer neither FM radio nor a headphone jack. So it's a one or the other. I can either get a Google Pixel with 5 years of updates and a decent camera, or a Nokia G400 5G that has (at best) one more year of updates but at least has a headphone jack and FM radio.
  So do I get the "terrible" Nokia smartphone with FM radio and call it a day or keep the Pixel 4a and buy an old Zune or something similar with FM radio and stuff that also in my already overbloated pockets? Or do I just go back to my ZTE Z320 Cymbal flip "dumbphone" with FM radio? Or do I just give up on FM radio? Or should I give up on cellphones? Cellphones bother me. People just call me to get things from me. No one ever calls me singing like Teresa Brewer nor with the latest local events going on in town. Or maybe it's time for a Facebook account and a Spottify subscription or rental or whatever you do with Spottify?

  Bluetooth hates me!
I recently got a pair of bluetooth IEMs. I really like how they sound, but after a few months of use the wireless aspect is more a point of concern than an advantage. Bluetooth inherently adds latency and the battery life already deteriorated to minutes instead of hours (bascially 10-20 minutes of listening before they're empty and the case doesn't store any additional charge anymore).

This is a problem that only came up in recent years. Netflix was great, but only while there weren't really any other services. You got a great deal where you could basically watch anything you wanted for $10-$20 USD per month. Nowadays you need a new subscription for each different series you want to watch and the market is segmented in a way where you will not save money anymore.

Digital downloads are a good change imo. Not having to take care of discs, always having a backup of your save files and the significantly more seamless online-experience are just a few of the many benefits.
  Game subscriptions are pretty good value though and do make sense in some cases. I'm not a big fan myself, but i can see how users might get value out of them. So far they haven't been as bad as Netflix for example. But i'm talking about bundles like Game Pass, not subscription to single games like WoW.

Old games will always look better on older TV's because that's what the game's creators were using to make the game. Newer games will always look better on newer displays. And with the introduction of OLED we're back at the CRT input lag times, just with a lot better picture quality.

There are things I like about newer vehicles, including EV's. I find how Tesla and Toyota have made motors that are both a permanent magnet motor, which works good for low RPM, and a reluctance motor, which works good at high RPM. The design is pretty genius. There are also many other things I love about the different EV's that are coming out. I also appreciate a lot of what has been possible with the internal combustion engine as well.
  But yes, the forced adoption of touch controls I don't like. I don't like having to take my eyes off the road to change things on an infotainment center.
  I'd also find it more practical if they'd make affordable not-so-tall station wagons as opposed to the popular CUV craze that's going on.
  Cars also mostly look the same to me anymore. And it appears people prefer driving around grey bricks more than anything. Not that CUV's aren't practical or can't be fun for their owners. But they don't look like "buy me! I'm fun and practical!" to me. Sedans also all look mostly the same, and the same with hatchbacks and pickups. Not that I am going to buy one, but I like the Tesla Cybertruck because it looks different. The same with the Aptera, I love the design and hope they come out with something with a back seat at some point.
  I also miss driving a manual, not because I like driving like a mad man, but because it gives me something I can do and be proud of. My last manual car had only 54 hp and I loved driving it. It seems that the emphasis now is on making cars fast and most don't have a stickshift. I don't like driving faster than the speed limit and I don't like taking off from a stoplight like a maniac. To me that's just immature, unless that acceleration is used on a track and not a public street or road. My Avalon has 200 hp and it feels overpowered to me as I never press the accelerator pedal all the way down. Yet, at least in the world of sedans, the main selling point they try to use is "buy this, it's more powerful than your car." But me: I want a family sized vehicle that is also fun to drive as per my deffinition of fun. And to me, driving a stickshift is fun. I don't like having to choose between a Mazda Miata or Nissan Versa and a Camry, although the Camry (which no longer comes with a manual transmission) would win as practicality for a family of four is more important.

I also always liked manual cars more, and in Germany there is still an abundance of manual cars to buy. But nowadays i find automatic so much more relaxed to drive, which is part of the reason why i like EV's so much. That and the punch when you floor it. I don't really want or need top speed, even though we still don't have a general speed limit on the autobahn but i really like the burst of power they have to overtake a truck for example.
  Nowadays i just want a car that can take me from point A to B in a comfrotable and economical manner and that's where EV's really shine. But alas, it wouldn't make financial sense to sell my already paid off A3 and buy another car that i'd need to pay off for the next few years just because i want a bit more comfort. My Audi is already way above the average car in terms of comfort. It's just the manual transmission that gets a bit annoying from time to time. (especially in traffic jams for example)

We did own an EV for a year, a 2013 Nissan Leaf. We sold it after needing a tow truck from the range cutting down to a mear 25-30 miles in the winter (compared to about 90 miles in the summer). I do think our next vehicle will be an EV, but for reasons other than supposedly being more fun to drive. While I thought I'd like the instant torque it turned out I wasn't as impressed by it as much as I thought I would be. You push the pedal and it goes, just like any other car. Having the torque ramp up a few milliseconds earlier doesn't really change the feel all that much for me personally. Modern cars also feel too heavy, as far as cornering is concerned, and EV's are even worse.
  Obviously there are places where a manual transmission would be a pain, like in traffic jams. But out in the country where I live there usually aren't any traffic jams unless you get stuck in a herd of cattle. And everyone's prefference is different. Some people can't stand to drive a manual, and I respect that.
  I'm with you as far as not getting another vehicle while the one I have works. I plan on keeping the Avalon for as long as possible. Once it's too expensive to keep running I'll look into getting something else. But if that day were today there isn't a single car out there right now that screams "Buy me! I'm exactly what you want!" even if cost weren't an issue. A manual transmission Toyota Camry (or similar) station wagon EV would be a dream come true. I suppose even if the manual transmission were a fake, simulated "transmission" I'd still enjoy it, although a smaller, less powerful EV motor with a two speed manual transmission that needs to drop down a gear at lower speeds to have enough torque to accelerate acceptably and then switch to the higher gear to drive at highway speeds would be plenty fine with me.
  Hey! I can dream, can't I?

Those games will never look right on a new screen, no matter how much filters you add it's analogue vs digital signals.
  Can't ignore the fact practically all modern TVs come with shit smart features, and are made to break within 5 years, while also being not worth to repair due to their size, cracking open anything bigger than 32" comes at the risk of cracking the brittle panel in half, if you can even get the cover off without shattering the corners, it's just not worth to repair most of those.
And that's why I got a CRT, also because I don't really download anything in HD so the resolution is just fine to me, I'm not that picky.
  The rest, I can't relate to. I despise anything with the word smart in its name so no smartphone, that means the headphone jack problem is not a problem for me. Phones are a huge scam, sort of like ink-jet printers or LED lights, I don't really have a need for one so... Sony Ericsson my beloved.
  Bluetooth sucks, not news. At least the Windows bluetooth manager does, the technology itself supports bidirectional transfer yet Windows hasn't changed the interface since what, XP? it's ridiculous.
Wireless and me don't get along, I just like cables. No wi-fi since there's no need for it, why have it when I have no devices to connect to the router? but also no wireless peripherals, the back of my desk surely is a mess but I don't have to replace or recharge batteries for anything.
  Movies, music, games... I'm a pirate, that's it, no secret. Not having to download 4+ launchers to play my games is sort of a blessing. Same for music, I use ye olde WMP for my mp3 collection. The new "Media Player" in Windows is fine too, works better with big collections like mine, about 15GB of files here. I still use discs to save movies and shows, gotta clear the hard drives every once in a while, remember I don't download 4K movies so most fit in a DVD. My TV is PAL so I try to store movies in 576i if possible, otherwise NTSC resolution is fine.

  To be honest, I liked Apple Music when I tried it. The main thing that turned me away is I feel I don't listen to enough music to justify the cost. At that price I can buy a CD every once in a while and have more than enough music to listen to. But there are some songs I can't get on CD, but I can on Apple Music. On the other hand, there are a couple songs I couldn't find on Apple Music.

  If I can't get Spotify to work, I don't know what to try next. I find I use my phone less and less for listening to music. In my mind I'm wondering if I should go with Apple Music, or just buy some CD's and rip them, or just stop listening to music all together.

 I dislike how disposable everything feels in the tech world nowadays. As the price of devices lower and repairability is sacriced, computers get thrown in the garbage much faster. And with things like the practice of buying a new phone every year and that sort of thing...
Many of the computers I use are perfectly good systems people have thrown out just because "Old puter need new" - they work absolutely fine and are fast enough for most people. In fact, I end up selling a ton of systems I've pulled out of the trash - it's sad how recent some of the stuff is. 12th gen Intel and Ryzen laptops... all completely functional.

Can't ignore the fact practically all modern TVs come with shit smart features, and are made to break within 5 years, while also being not worth to repair due to their size, cracking open anything bigger than 32" comes at the risk of cracking the brittle panel in half, if you can even get the cover off without shattering the corners, it's just not worth to repair most of those.
And that's why I got a CRT, also because I don't really download anything in HD so the resolution is just fine to me, I'm not that picky.
Similar to what I was talking about, planned obsolescence is a huge issue. 
All of my monitors are 20-year-old CCFL-backlit LCDs, stuff that would've cost thousands new but was free from the side of the road. Easy to service, great colors, won't break if you sneeze near it like modern panels do.

Throwing out 12th gen Intel! I just built my desktop with 12th gen Intel this year because my second gen Intel desktop kept crashing and having USB issues and I tried fixing it but couldn't figure it out. If I wasn't having so many issues with the ol' desktop, I wouldn't have built a new one. I did use a few parts off of the old one like the hard drive. It makes a great backup drive.

 Ok. So I got Spotify figured out. I had Spotify blocked on my DNS router. So this was my fault.
  I see I can download songs, so that will be nice for areas without internet coverage. But I think that's only possible with the Premium trial.
  I think Spotify will work with HTML and CSS coding in Spacehey, so that's nice.
  I didn't notice podcasts in Apple Music, but it's nice to see them in Spotify. I can just use Google Podcasts, but there's no knowing when Google will ax that idea, because... Google. However, I love that I can download the actual video. Unless I'm missing something. Google Podcasts is audio only. So if I want to listen to the WAN show but then there's a "Look at this everybody!" coming from Linus then I just have to try to imagine what he and Luke are talking about. So that's even better than Google Podcasts!
  But will the $10 per month be worth it? I guess I'll try it for a while and see. It seems to have more stuff than Apple Music, like the podcast and CSS abilities, so maybe it's worth it.

If you're in the US, a used Zune HD is one of the cheapest ways to get a portable HD Radio tuner. (Aside from doing it in software with an SDR dongle, that is.) They don't have a ton of onboard storage by today's standards, but they're physically small and their capacity is irrelevant if you've got your phone for playing MP3s.

 Older equipment would have a good toggle switch, mechanical and can be felt, not looked at, while now you need to press 3 or 4 times on a screen to get the same type of thing to switch on or off.
  Our caravan has that for switching the water pump on. The old one didn't even have a switch, simply plugging the pump in on the side of the van was enough. Admittedly if the outside water tank ran dry you had to go out and unplug the pump but why not a simply toggle switch inside instead of pressing so many times on a screen?

 I guess one thing that makes me kind of sour with newer tech is that better tech is more expensive. I mean, take displays for an example. I currently have an LCD display for a monitor/TV. I can get another for dirt cheap, but with a lot of the same LCD problems such as glowing "blacks" and noticeable motion blur. Sure, there are ones a bit better, but they cost more and are still LCD with the same LCD problems I already have. I'd love to get an OLED, but the cheapest monitor that satisfies my list of wants is apparently almost $1,000. Ouch! And since I use my computer for reading text there's the question if W-OLED or Q-OLED would be clear enough since neither type of OLED has standard RGB subpixels. And then there's the burn-in concern. So, I guess I just keep the LCD screen I already have, which I don't like, because there's not anything that I like enough to justify the cost.
  I guess I'm just sour and frugal.
  I am looking forward to nano-LED technology though. Hopefully it will be as great as promised.

I think we have better luck with good ol' free ATSC TV than trying to figure out what's subscription services have the movies and shows we like.
ATSC 3.0 is adding DRM in to the mix. For people like me that use Plex to watch and record OTA TV this means I will have to ensure I have a working internet connection because you will need to download a license to record / watch recorded content, when the license runs out then you can do shit. It also limits transcoding as well. Not to mention you probably cant just copy the file to an external disk and watch in VLC. On top of the fact 4K will never come to broadcast TV. They can use the extra bandwidth for data transmission and thats what broadcasters intend.

By "good ol' ATSC" I was referring to 1.0. 3.0 is another thing I don't like how it's going. As far as I've read only TV's have been able to decode the DRM thus far, and recording will be limited in some way we don't know yet, perhaps making it impossible to use with Plex.

This one is pretty annoying all we can do is keep pushing back.  Fortunately, it doesn't affect anything yet.  The problem is they picked a licensed codec for ATSC 3.  Really, I don't know why they even encrypt it nobody is ever going to pay for OTA.  If they want to offer something like HBO or a premium movie channel that I can understand, just encrypt those specific channels.   But encrypting everything will prevent adoption...

I'm in tech generally I just find a way around it not always "legal" but generally "lawful".  "Legal" is the enslavement term where they trap you into agreeing to arbitrary rules through the confusion and mindless followers pushing the "I do this, so should everyone else" rule (I see the same mentality letting homeowners associations get away with pretty much anything).  The trap was in motion while the ink was still drying on the constitution.  People need to stop petitioning, realize they are the boss, and start demanding in mass.  And fire anyone in office that breaks the rules.  So sick of joking about politicians lying, cheating, and stealing but not doing anything about it.

SNES would draw to the CRT line by line, as CRT's effectively have an electron gun that sweeps across the screen.  There was still some delay, but overall the delay was pretty small and the frame is only as delayed as it takes to draw all the lines on the screen.
  Modern TV's expect essentially an image to display, not a line.
  For modern systems like Switch, when playing SNES games they use an emulator, which still then has to effectively emulate the same rendering line by line...so they usually have a buffer that they are storing the rendered image in and then when they reach the last line they have the image, in about the same timing as the original console did...but now they have to actually send it; which at that stage it means you send it to the TV which has latency.

People do pay for OTA content however. They are known as your cable and satellite TV provider. The encryption is to stop services from grabbing the signal and reselling it to consumers because many times these services dont have agreements with the broadcasters. Many of these services have been shut down over the last few years. So the broadcasters solution is punish the people who are following the law.

I'll add to @Donut417's post. I assume public broadcasting makes its money from commercials. If you can record it there's a much bigger chance you won't watch the commercials. ATSC 3.0 certified TV's should be able to show encrypted signals no problem. But you can't record on those TVs, you can only watch.

 A lot of stuff are relatively minor specifics, but what I'm really worried about is technology being the end of personal privacy and freedom. A lot of the things people mention in this thread are practical repercussions of this larger trend behind it. Both major companies and governments are using technology to monitor more and more details of our lives, and the resulting data and bubbles are used to manipulate us into doing their bidding. Slowly but surely we're moving towards a situation where the information asymmetry is so large you really don't stand a chance.
  When companies are not actively working against your best interests, they hide behind massive faceless corporate walls, where you can't talk to actual humans, and especially no one with any real decision making power. People are locked out of their accounts and lose access to significant parts of their lives and the company doesn't care at all.
  It already is impossible to act or move without your movements being logged extensively, or use any service or company without the same, and it's not getting better.

Overall, technology is great, in my opinion. But there are some things I just don't like how they are going.
  I want my headphone jack!
Take the deletion of the headphone jack for an example. Now I had to get a Bluetooth to FM transmitter in order to hook up my wife's new Pixel phone to the car stereo, inspite of the car having an AUX port. I guess I could get a type C to headphone jack adapter, but then she charges her phone mostly in the car. The car, a 2013 Toyota Avalon, also has Bluetooth but it has stopped working, twice. About a year after taking it to a dealer and spending hundreds to get it fixed it stopped working again. This kind of stuff just leaves a bad taste in my mouth for newer technology.
Expand  
There is no reason for the elimination of the 3.5mm headphone jack. None. Not even on smartphones. The removal of it from car stereo's is kinda weird because most car stereos never , EVER, had them until mp3 players came out, but before bluetooth was a thing, and then once every car had Bluetooth and Wifi, and USB ports, they all started disappearing again.
  Repeat after me: Bluetooth is BAD at EVERYTHING it is used for. It is wireless USB 1.1 and should not be used for anything that needs to look, sound or perform good. This is not a bug, this is a feature of Bluetooth because it uses the 2.4Ghz spectrum that is super congested.

Bluetooth hates me!
Bluetooth usually doesn't work for me. Not only does it not work in the car, I also went and bought my first bluetooth headphones and am also having problems with them too. Yes I got some cheap ones, a brand called PowerLocus, but I got them because of another thing. My current phone, the Pixel 4a, doesn't have FM radio. I bought these headphones because they also have an FM tuner in them, which works ok for listening to FM radio (sometimes I have to angle my head just right at work to get the signal).
See above. Don't use bluetooth unless the only option is proprietary dongle. Because the proprietary dongle will slam the 2.4ghz frequency with garbage where at least if you only put BT stuff on 2.4Ghz and shut off the 2.4ghz WiFi you have a much better chance of low-interferance.

Why have wireless if I need to wire them to my body anyway?!
Personally I prefer earphones (AKA earbuds) instead of headphones. Between me forgeting to plug in and charge my PowerLocus FM headphones and also not having an easy way to carry them around when not in use I end up just using my trusty Skull Candy wired earphones instead (at least my own phone has a headphone jack). Taking note of this, my mom got me some Beats wireless earphones as a present, but they need a lightning cable to charge, which I had to go buy one, and they fall off my ears. At least the Skull Candy ones are wired and therefore tethered to me. I don't see the point of using wireless earphones that I need to tie a string to so I can tie them to some part of my body anyway.
Expand  
All wireless headphones suck to some degree, it's just a question of how much you use them. My $50 sony ear buds replaced a previous nearly-identical set I got from a kiosk in (I think Chicago Central Station.) It may not be the "best" quality, but I can't stand wearing heavy headphones, and too many headphones style pinch my ears and it's just horrible all around. Earbuds or "call center style headphones (where they have a 1/2" band and lightweight speakers) only.

Where am I supposed to watch movies or get my music?!
I'm just not into some of these subscription services. Maybe I haven't tried enough of them, but the ones I've tried I just haven't liked. Netflix is horrible. When we first got it there were several movies we really liked. They are not on Netflix anymore and trying to find something to watch that we like on there is very hard. We've tied Hulu as well. I think we have better luck with good ol' free ATSC TV than trying to figure out what's subscription services have the movies and shows we like. The same with Music. I can't figure out Pandora, and while Apple Music is kind of nice they still don't have everything I'm looking for. I just don't feel I have the time to keep trying out subscription services that I feel probably won't be worth it in the end anyway. So I just listen to less music and watch fewer movies than ever before. Maybe this is a good thing.
Expand  
Netflix and Disney+ are fine for now. But they've removing stuff they actually own the rights to, and so have services like Paramount, and it's like ... Do these guys know what they're doing? No clearly they don't anymore. The reason I'm paying to sub to these services is because there is content I regularly want to watch or re-watch, and if you keep taking that content away from me, I'm just going to eventually cancel the account.
  I used to only buy Disney DVD/BD discs because I had a "Disney Movie Club" but then Disney stopped allowing digital redeems to iTunes in Canada, so I canceled that. What's the point of paying for a digital download that you can't redeem, and expires? Curse Disney for that. If Disney+ keeps going down the path it's going, that's getting canceled as well.
  Repeat: I bought Disney+ because Disney wasn't allowing me to redeem the digital downloads I paid for.  I've instead just ripped the BD on the PC and watched that instead, saving me the huge PITA of trying to redeem it on a crappy fly-by-night digital download service in Canada.

I hate digital downloads and game subscriptions!
This whole subcription plan thing also pushes me away from wanting to get any newer console like a Switch. I can't get any online content on my Wii anymore. So Instead of buying newer consoles I put together a MiSTer and bought some old cartidges and CDs and prefer playing that instead of having to think about what subscriptions on what consoles get me the games we like to play and wondering how much longer those particular consoles and games will be supported.
I bought a Analogue SuperNT, MegaSG, NT Mini and Pocket and have just played the original carts. Unfortunately ebay is pretty much nothing but repro counterfeits, so don't give those guys money unless you can see the PCB of the cart and compare it to scanned photos of the original carts. There are plenty of ways to tell them apart. Ask to have the cart opened at used game stores if necessary.

Why can't they figure out a TV that looks good (to me)?!
That and I don't like how a lot of games look and feel on modern TV's. I've played some NES and SNES games on a couple of Switches that belong to friends, but I feel like something is messed up. When I go back home and drag out the ol' SNES and CRT I feel like it's almost an entirely different game. The controls feel responsive and the graphics look better IMO. I do find the MiSTer seems to do much better than the Switch in this regard. Maybe it's the Switch's controls, since I use original OEM controls via a low-latency USB adapter to use on the MiSTer. But having more options on the MiSTer to try to make the image look more like an actual CRT is a dream come true! I'm saving my pennies for a Retrotink 5x so I can have similar filters on my other retro consoles. If they put these options on a Switch I'd be more interested in one. But also a TV that had the option to look more CRTish would be great too. I find LCD screens to blur more when things are in motion and on mine the blacks seem to glow really badly. I've never seen an OLED in person, so maybe that would be a good TV, but I don't think I could afford one and am fearful of burning in.
Expand  
  All CRT-Era consoles (which include's the Wii, but not "exactly" since it uses bluetooth) were developed with zero latency controllers. When you play them on anything that is not a CRT, you have the unfortunate problem that it has to go through the smartTV's processing logic and upscaler. If you want to play a vintage CRT-era game and do not have a Vintage CRT ( fortunately have one, but the transformer makes so much noise that I have to physically unplug it to sleep) your best option is to get a 4K IPS COMPUTER MONITOR that is actually labeled as 144hz, and not a "television." You can also try your luck with 4K OLED. The reason for this is the math for integer scale. So vintage 224/240/256 line systems scale directly upwards without needing to crop them. 2880x2160 = 9 x 240p
  Personally, i'm not in love with using software filters to "mimic" CRT defects on a LCD display, and you want a 4K monitor to do that if you want to go that route, because the shadow mask(Aperture Grille) in trinitron monitors were RGB stripes vertically oriented and each color line is (on a television) 0.25mm, So on a 32" 4K monitor the pixel pitch is about 0.18mm (so one "pixel" fits within the stripe of a color on a trinitron.) Basically what I'm saying here is that you will never get a perfect alignment with "crt filters" and this is one of the cases where a 4K screen actually is the correct resolution for integer scale AND has the necessary resolution to do CRT filters.
  But when you run filters, you are adding latency. Which is why I've generally stuck with just integer scale, since even the FPGA upscalers tend to only start having induced latency when the pixel data has to change.

Am I too old fashioned?
Maybe I'm just too old fashioned. Part of the reason I don't get into newer tech is I'm not that interested in newer songs, movies or videogames. Which is weird. I love the NES, the SNES, the N64 and the Gamecube! The Wii is ok, but I never felt the urge to buy a WiiU or a Switch. I can't figure it quite out, but playing at other people's homes on their consoles, games like Mario Odyessy and Breath of the Wild for some reason don't appeal to me even though I've always been a Mario and Zelda fan. I'm not sure what it is about these games that I don't like, but I just don't. The only reason I would want a Switch right now is to play Metroid Dread, and buying a whole console to play just one game just doesn't make sense. I mean, I absolutely love Link's Awakening, but I don't like the 3D graphics on the new Switch version. Why? I don't know, I guess it's just me, but my better half has similar opinions. So I guess it's just us.
Expand  
  I bought a switch and have barely played it.  I hate the joycons, and bought the pro controller. But playing SNES stuff on it feels kinda sluggish (I even bought SNES pads for it.)

Other stuff.
And we haven't even gotten into other things like cars. I don't like touch screens, generally speaking, especially in cars. 
  Do you agree or disagree? Is there something in tech you don't like the way it's headed?
My personal opinion is that we are being served "junkified", phones, cars, computers, laptops, clothing, food, etc
  Products are not been engineered to last 30 years, they're being engineered to last "just long enough" to get you to want to replace it, and I blame a lot of this on the cell phone business, encouraging people to throw their old phones out every year. That's now also the case for nearly all consumer devices and appliances that don't weight 100lbs. (eg you'll never convince someone to replace their fridge or stove every 3 years, because they generally last forever... but because of computer boards, they've now started failing quite frequently.)
  Microwaves are one of those really awful pain points, where there is nothing ever wrong with the actual "microwave" it's always the stupid PCB behind the keypad, because guess what? People cook, moisture, and grease get into it. One of the reasons why "luxury" brands are basically "euro market" devices. "trash products" all come from asia or america. They are not engineered to last.
  Especially cars. It seems like every continent takes turns making a good car, and then there's a decade of stuff that nobody should be buying.
  I'm still seeing the occasional 80's volvo or k-car around. But but most of them are long gone due to Shell ruining them all in the early 2000's with a fuel additive that wrecked a lot of them.
  Junkified clothing is also so awful, I wish "3d printing" would invest heavily into this market. I know predecessors to such things exist (eg auto-looms) and stuff exist, but what I want is to basically take a template, give it a color swatch to use, thread count and "dress/shirt size" to make and have perfectly sized clothing, every time. No more closets of crappy wear-once clothing that you know you're never going to wear again. If you need a dress shirt now? Make one. Need a tuxedo or prom or wedding dress? Make one. Maybe some final assembly is required for clothing that contains embellishments of different materials.
  But instead these fly-by-night counterfeit clothing websites show up, always with the same drop-shipper images, same issues, same problems, every time. They sell clothing that is obnoxiously poor quality, and people keep buying from them because they are uninformed.
  We've reached a point where so much "fake" stuff is on the "the web" that "the web" as a source will be eventually discarded. There is no web 3.0, there never will be.  The future is Discord-clones. And I hate it.

If they're not going to operate the service then syndicate everything to Netflix, Amazon and Apple.  Heck, they might even make more money that way. But honestly, I feel that Paramount's content itself is good, but nobody wants to pay for just one channel's content. HBO it is not.
    Like the reason people wanted a-la-carte cable was because they were sick of having "basic cable" that only carried the local fox/cbs/nbc affiliate, and 90 garbage channels they don't watch that were more ads than than content. Ugh I remember "USA network" back when we had the C-band dish, and that channel was so ballsy to cut 4 minutes from every syndicated show on top of the openings just to show more ads.

Thanks! That also makes sense.
  The point is, if people can record and then watch it for free, without commercials, without a subscription to cable or Hulu or other, or worse yet someone records it and then puts it on the internet so everyone can watch it for free, then the broadcasting companies don't have a way of making money. So I get it from their perspective.
  The problem is then you don't have a single converter box that will display ATSC 3.0. So now you have to buy an ATSC 3.0 TV as of right now if you want those channels. That's one part of the problem. The other is we don't have any DVR functions yet that work with encrypted ATSC 3.0.

If you watch often, yes. But we watch a movie once every two or three months and don't watch many shows except on broadcast TV. So our best bet is to just buy the DVD. Why pay for Netflix and Disney+ every month if we don't use them at least once every month? Of course if we had them again maybe we'd watch more movies.

I'm using the ERGO M575 it has only bluetooth and it's own dongle, currently using BT on the PC. Just to say again. Bluetooth tends to be awful at everything. But generally mouse and keyboard it'll be fine at because neither are high bandwidth. But given a choice between wired or wireless. I want a DETACHABLE USB cable for mice and keyboards, because I'm absolutely sick and annoyed having computer mice either:
a) left click wearing out
b) right click wearing out
c) mouse wheel wearing out
d) mouse wire fails 2-3 inches from the mouse
  Trackballs have one additional moving part over a mouse (because they have a "ball") over optical/laser mice, but unlike my older trackball, I can spin this ball extremely fast and it doesn't reverse direction, (which is what the previous two logitech trackballs do, given they were older optical technology (red ball with dots.) The one that didn't do it was the original one (with the cyan ball color) but it worked literately like an upside down mouse with the rollers.)
  You know what really ticks me off? I bought an ASUS ROG Gladius 3, and OUT OF THE BOX a few months ago, and the mouse wheel reverses every few clicks down on the mouse wheel that I eventually just gave up on it. Beyond the return time. What I wanted was the ROG Gladius 2 which had the detachable cable, not available. This replaced the original model Gladius... which ... the rubber grips glue melted from normal use. It's just each subsequent mouse was worse than the last. "Junkification"
  I've had much better luck and longevity from the the last two track balls than I've had with any of the mice I've had in the meantime save for the one microsoft mouse. I pretty much have to replace the mouse every two to three years. Trackballs give me much more time, but they still "button wear" just as hard.

How is this different then someone sharing a movie or music? Those industries use the courts and the DMCA like they are suppose to. Someone puts content up you send them a DMCA letter. They keep doing it, you sue the pants off of them. If its a business doing it you slap them with an injunction. Then you have to courts tell them to stop. 
  All encryption does is make law abiding people consider piracy or they stop using the product or service. Either way they would be out money. The fact also is the FCC does allow them to offer paid channels as long as they provide the .1 channels for free. So ABC for example could theoretically offer Disney+ content on a paid channel for those people without good internet service.

Exactly! I'm just trying to see it from both sides. But yes, encrypting public broadcasts hurts the end user and doesn't accomplish much.
  I still think there is no perfect way of doing things that benefits everyone to the degree they want benefited. Companies want all the money they can get regardless of what products or services they provide. People want all the products and services they can get and for free if possible, unless it's to show off their bad spending habbits. You'd think we could find a happy medium, but that isn't going to happen.

I was under the understanding that the encryption isn't being done to make paid-for over-the-air broadcasts possible. I'm pretty sure it's only being done as a way to supposedly stop piracy. In other words the channels are all still free and will continue to be so. You just need to watch them an a certified TV and only on a certified TV, unless they come out with a certified box that can encrypt the HDMI signal so only your TV can decipher the original signal. That way they can control how you record and watch over-the-air shows.

I dont think you understood what I wrote. I was saying they could keep the main channels unencrypted and use the sub channels to offer paid content. Thats how they could make extra money. Maybe offer premium channels like HBO or content from Stream providers like Disney+. Piracy is going to always exist. DVD and Blurays both have encryption built on the disk. How long did it take before it was broken? Games have DRM built in, how long does it take before its cracked? They are in a battle they cant win. It just like The Pirate Bay, they have taken it down soooooo many times but it just pops back up. 
  Fucking over the average person is how you lose. Because most people are willing to do things the legal way as long as its not a big hassle and takes away from what they have been doing all along.

I think I understood you just fine. You're talking about something that could be done. As far as I understand there are no plans or talk that they will use it for paid content. In other words, there will be no HBO or Disney+ on anything ATSC. That's not what encryption is for.
  According to Cordcuttersnews.com, "Enabling security is the first step in preventing the theft of a broadcaster’s high-value content and delivering to viewers the free over-the-air TV they want to enjoy." So it's because "piracy" not because they could charge for content.

LCD/OLED also receive and display the signal line by line, and pixel by pixel on each of those lines. There has been at least one LCD monitor that was converted to "zero lag" but had sync issues while gaming. A lot of gaming monitors have half a frame of lag, which should be imperceptible to nearly all retro gamers.
  Still, I find that modern consoles (i.e. Nintendo Switch) seem to add their own lag to retro games, and way too much of it. I can game on an LCD with a MiSTer or an original console and a RetroTink or other upscaler. It doesn't look as good IMO. But to me, some games are unplayable on modern consoles. I can beat Super Mario 1, 2 and 3 on the MiSTer, with either an old LCD I use or a CRT. But if I try them on the Switch I feel like I can't hardly get past the first world. Something just feels out of place on the Switch. That and Nintendo's way of rendering retro games doesn't look very good to me, albeit much better than on the Wii.
  Generally speaking, everything on a modern console adds lag. Wireless controllers add lag. Software emulation adds lag. Digital flat panel TVs add lag. So in the end it all adds up, and I think that's what makes it so hard for me to play.
  You also can't get a true interlaced picture on an LCD or OLED, so have to resort deinterlacing which also adds lag on those consoles and games that interlaced content is the only way to go, and deinterlacing also adds lag and visual artifacts.
  I need to fix my CRT NTSC TV as it has stopped working. Which is a bummer, because playing lag free with RF, composite, S-video, Y-Pb-Pr and RGB options all on one CRT display is awesome. If only it had a PAL option (and actually worked again) it would be perfect!

 Mandatory software updates that don't support your device for reasons, and now you cannot play your DRM'd single player games anymore.
Even though the machine is more capable than the average recent system.

 Yet another thing I hate about changing tech is I was assigned an EAS (Exchange ActiveSync) email account. For a while it worked just fine with Outlook.
  But then Outlook stopped supporting EAS so I had to move over to the Windows Mail app.
  However, now Microsoft is killing the Windows Mail app and Outlook still doesn't support EAS. So either my employer will have to pay for a different kind of account or I'll have to find some other way to see my EAS emails, either on mobile, or some other app, or in a web browser (which I don't want the latter because I do go places without internet and need to see my emails).
  Is Microsoft trying to push me to buy an iPad?

But actually, it should say that printers hate me. I haven't had as many problems with any device of the modern era as with these junk boxes. It's unbelievable what kind of garbage is pushed into the consumer market.

 Video games, they keep having more and more inflated specs requirements (more powerful GPU needed for minimum spec, for example some games need a frigging RX 6700 XT!), while looking only slightly better than games half a decade old.

Is this because it's like 8K vs 4K? Sure, 8K is better, but can the naked eye really tell the difference? Will people really care about 16K displays?
  It sounds like that in order to improve things have to go in a different direction (i.e. AR, VR, etc.).

 CPUs are becoming hotter with more power consumption each generation, GPUs are becoming more expensive and having everything locked down(like voltage and power limits)

Power consumption has gone up but power/core and especially power efficiency for actual compute power have gone down.
  This also ignores the rise of ARM processors like Apple Silicon which have like a TDP of 20W. Also Intel is really far behind on die shrink; they're at 10nm in their 13th generation processors while AMD and Apple are both at 5 nm. Apple is already working on 3nm.
  So like, Intel is kind of skewing the results right now because of their lithography. But for everyone else, processors are getting more efficient even by TDP to TDP comparison.

Let's see if AMD or Intel can pull a trick comparable with "Core" like 2006.
  In any case, I suggest you to benchmark 2 65W CPUs (one from 2015, one from 2022) and 2 35W CPUs (one from 2015, one from 2022).
I think that power draw was similar, not computational power.

The transistor lithography values given are all marketing. It doesn't actually represent any value anymore, and hasn't for quite a while.

You right but die shrink is still die shrink.

But you can't compare Intel to AMD and Apple's lithographies based on what they or their suppliers call the nodes. You have to understand first what the lithographies actually are before you can compare them.

 I hate the reduction of bezels on phones.
I don't use a case with my iPhone 14 Pro and I'm always accidentally touching screen elements on the edges.
  The removal of TOSLINK outputs from consoles is stupid. It requires the user to buy an audio extractor or use a home theater receiver if they want to use their consoles on a monitor. Sure, monitors typically have an analog output but it sounds awful.

  Technically, I think 4K is probably the comfortable limit. I'm sure "8K" will exist, but I would prefer it exist as VR/AR tech (eg 4K per eye) because as far as conventional monitors go, a 4K screen at 24" is comfortable, or 27" is fine, but sticking anything larger than 24" on most desktops IS overkill, since 3 x 24" fits on a 6' desk easily, but 3x27" needs monitor arms, and at 4K each, it's a diminishing return. You need 4K on the screen you look at, work and play on. But if you just need monitors up to do work, then 1080p is just fine and the only reason to have 4K on all monitors is to keep windows from randomly changing DPI.
