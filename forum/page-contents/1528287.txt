 So I have a very specific problem where I don't have almost any power available on my power supply on it's 5V rail and I'm unable to run any hard drives without them losing power intermittently. Although I do have more than enough power on my 12V rail but I have no PCI-E connectors or really any power connectors I can tap into directly on my power supply so I was wondering since I have a free PCI-E port if there was a card that could tap into it's 75W (I assuming it's 12V) max power draw for the slot and step it down to 5V and go out via Molex (so I could use one of those daisy chain cables) or a SATA Power connector. (I really really don't want to buy a new PSU) Does anyone know if hardware like that exists?
 If you were drawing more power on the 5V rail than the PSU could supply, it would shut down the entire PC, with OCP triggering. The issue you're having is caused by something else. 
  Corsair does however sell what you're asking for.

 Thank you!
 How on earth have you came to the conclusion that hard drive faults are related to your psus 5v power? 
  That's like saying my engine has seized it must be the gas I used.
  In other words it's technically possible but extremely unlikely.

Because whenever I have my SSD attached to my PSU my hard drives make a clicking noise and restart themselves constantly but as soon as I take off the SSD from the PSU they work just fine

So it arrived today and I assumed it was powered by a barrel jack or something I couldn't see in the photo's of it apparently not on closer inspection it requires a extra CPU power plug on my PSU which I don't have so I just wasted my money.. No ones fault but mine

https://www.amazon.com/8-Pin-EPS-12V-Female-Splitter-Cable/dp/B01JC4D3NU would this not work?
 Nope because I don't have any available connectors on the PSU except the 5V ones which are at capacity
 The only way I think I convert any 12V down to 5V is getting some PCI-E to 5V Molex connector which I haven't found yet

Why aren't you just buying a step-down converter and convert the 12v on the molex cable to 5v?
