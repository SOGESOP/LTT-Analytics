 If that's an A1286 Core 2-based 2008 MacBook Pro, you can't run Sierra on it.
  Highest macOS version you can run is OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan.

What version of macOS does it have installed now?
  Have you tried installing an older version of macOS(such as 10.10 or 10.11), and then manually updating it to Sierra or High Sierra from inside macOS?
