 So… a few months ago I built a new, custom pc from scratch, my very first. 
A few weeks later, the computer had a hard freeze, meaning my inputs had no response, the only thing I could do was restart it. I thought little of this, as my drivers were not updated, ( foreshadowing), however it froze again the same day.
it has now, for a while, froze at least 3 times a day, I use the computer for, at the most, 3 hours a day.
No unusual ram usage, or overheating.

 Use DDU and completely delete all gpu drivers then re install them. Check if any other drivers have an update, try using one RAM stick in one slot.
 Will do, will report after some testing
