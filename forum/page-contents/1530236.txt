 GPU launches have sucked for a while, but that doesn’t mean all of them will. While we’re still saddled with inflating price tags, certain PC gamers might just find AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT compelling...
   
 Is that a cheeky dub at 1:47?
 Not sure I want to try Team Red again for a GPU, but the 7800XT looks like it might be a decent choice for Starfield.

There's actually a good number of Dubs. Which is good. Since they'll be doing it more, they probably need to think about the dubbing studio's setup a bit. The reflection times in a small booth compared to a large room (normal shooting) means the dubs sound different. In this case, higher reverb and the spatial feel is much closer. Though dubs always have tone differences because the voice changes slightly during the day and between days. Something you don't notice until you put clips back to back.
  The dubs definitely made the video flow smoother, which is the point of them. The audio can be fixed a bit with some time to attempt to match it to the normal LMG audio setup, since it'll be more regular.
  I think they've used some form of this graphics setup before, right? Either way, I like the new graphics package for the charts. While 1% lows first is a different take than most, it's valid and useful. Glad to also see Production benchmarks hanging around.
  I did like the "well, we're waiting" section. AMD's communication on the FSR3 release has been a little lacking. They clearly announced it a tad early or final prep took a little too long. As for working in all games on certain APIs, this isn't the first time AMD as come up with general stuff for their driver package. That's actually been a regular thing. AMD Chill originally only worked in like 30 games until someone on their staff figured out how to get it to work in everything. So I could see most of the stuff they're working working at the driver level like that. We'll just have to see.
 Some sources whom shall not be named says that AMD considers RX 7800 XT is a successor of RX 6800 (non XT). I'm glad CVO address this thing as well
  It seems that AMD is dropping non XT branding on 7x00 series cards, seeing that they have too many lineup at 6x00 series cards and drop of demand because of *cough* crypto crash
Or AMD product development is just as old as me, where in their teenage years, more X's means more cool (RX 7900 XTX has 3 Xs', *wink* *wink*)
  I do notice some 'hiccup' on CVO voice at some segments, it's either caused by the battery on the microphone has sudden voltage drop, or signal interference, or intentional in post-production process
Hiccup time stamp:
4:18-4:20 (nice)
6:09-6:14 (also nice)

I like the dubs, even if they don't sound perfect.
  As someone who often has LTT and other YT videos on a second display or on a tablet whilst I'm doing something else, I'm strongly against 'correcting' audible/verbal errors with on screen text. I don't think this is an appropriate solution as it will often not be seen.
 There is one error in the video as I don't think the rx 6800 has gen 2 ray tracing cores
    But still enjoyed the video as it did seem like a lot of progress has been made with more Dubs for mistakes and also otherwise nicer to look at graphs that guide the viewers eyes to where to look.
 AMD was really "good heart" making a new GPU for these cards... If it was my decision, I would just pick the last gen and rebrand it. Everybody knows that people are dumb and would use these cards to reduce the price of the much inferior RTX 4060 to buy them, or would buy a cheaper used card and want these new ones to reduce their price too...
Also Radeon team can't make the 7800 XT any faster because of the 7900 XT performance being similar to the 6950 XT, if they make the new card faster would make it compete with the higher tier one.
  They probably can't reduce too much the price of the 7000 series because is expensive to make and dollar inflation, your money cost less.

Good catch. @LMGcommunity plz tell the team to pin a note in the comments about this!
Nothing deal breaking here but something to fix none-the-less.
 Got a reference 6800XT in Oct 2021 at MSRP. 
By the time Ethereum was no longer minable, I had mined $500CAD worth, so the GPU was about $500 all in.

Great card for playing games, it's wild how much crypto distorted the market for value.
 Not sure if it got removed accidentally or not but the Labs Testing number hasn't been added. @LMGcommunity
 Should I upgrade to the 7800xt or the 6800xt from my 5700xt? Or should I just wait for the next gen?

  The 6800 XT and 7800 XT are about twice as fast as your card.
  If you're buying now, get the 7800 XT, as it matches or slightly beats the 6800 XT at about the same price and can get better with driver updates.

    I went from a 5700XT to a 6800 which is roughly double the performance. The 6800XT/7800XT would be a bit above that.
  But I agree, AMD usually improves the performance over the years with drivers, the 7800XT would probably be the better choice if they are the same price, or a small difference.

  I generally use TechPowerUp's relative percentage rankings for these things, and they have the 6800 at 169% of the 5700 XT's performance and the 6800 XT at 192%. 
  But yeah a safe approximation is to say it will be roughly double the performance of the card he has now depending on game, resolution, and settings of course. 
   
 Im glad amd priced this where it did, the comparisons to last gen dont really mean much to me...just ordered one yesterday, should be a great upgrade to my aging 1060 6gb.

I am using the info I got last November when I was shopping, it was around double.
But it doesn't matter much, the performance improvement over the 5700XT is still really huge.
I couldn't max Forza Horizon 4 at 1440 without it getting frame drops into the 40s, and even at medium it sometimes had trouble getting a stable 72fps, and with the 6800 I can not only max it, it runs at a stable 120fps+

  It's a decent purchase for someone in a position like yours. A lot of people were just hoping for a meaningful performance jump from the 6000 series cards since it's been over two years now, especially because Nvidia's cards in this segment were big disappointments. But the reality seems to be that for better or for worse, the days of big generation-on-generation jumps in GPU performance are over, and the average person has no "need" to upgrade more often than every other gen.
 Anybody else notice the new Labs logo on the graphs and on James' t-shirt on today's TechLinked?  I like the NASA meets Aperture Science vibe it gives.

7900 XT really is not similar to a 6950 XT at all.

  Eh, any of these random YouTube comparison channels don't mean much, their data is often spurious.
  TechPowerUp has the 7900 XT 15% ahead of the 6950 XT on average. I'd say that's similar. It's similar enough a person who currently has a 6950 XT has no reason to buy a 7900 XT.

The 6950 is heavily clocked already, 7900's can do 3ghz easily.
  Not really even a fair comparison LOL. Most folks buy AIB, well the AIB is going to train wreck a stock 7900.
   
 Yea biggest "flaw" with the 7800xt is the xt at the end, It launched way cheaper than the 6800xt, and is meant to replace the 6800. calling it the xt inevitably leads us all to compare it with the EOL 6800xt that is being sold at a deep discount at the same price and buries the generational gain.

With that in mind, I really like these two cards.

  I've had AMD fanboys argue to me that this card is really a replacement for the 6700 XT, and we have to look at the performance gain compared to it. But if AMD wants to play these marketing games where they shift the naming scheme to make products seem higher-end than they really are, then they have to accept people will judge the products by that standard.
  (This was what my status update about AMD's deceptive marketing actually making the product look worse instead of better was referring to.)
  AMD should have called these cards the 7700 and 7700 XT, but they chose not to. Of course, this would have created a glaring gap in the product lineup where there is no x800 "tier" card, and I don't know what you do about that. In retrospect maybe the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX should have been the 7800 XT and 7900 XT, respectively, but going from $500 MSRP to $900 MSRP with no option in between is a yikes. 
  Delivering the same performance as the 6800 XT at a lower launch MSRP sounds nice in a vacuum, but we aren't comparing to the MSRP of the 6800 XT from three years ago, we have to compare to what it goes for now. Of course, the 6800 XT's will soon be unavailable new, but what we're left with is a "new" card that performs about the same as the previous one at about the same price. Not bad if you're running something two generations or more behind, and probably better value than what Nvidia has in this segment, but certainly nothing to get excited over.

7900xt already had its MSRP cut. But yes 500 to 800 is a bit of a leap. The 7900 GRE needs a global launch to fill in that gap, even if it's a dumb buy value-wise.

Inevitably the 7800xt will have its prices go down over the years. launching a new card at the price/performance of a deep discount last-gen card is pretty normal, so I don't slight AMD for doing that here. Its just there is no proper replacement for what the 6800xt was in the line. You can speculate that you will be able to find the 7800xt consistently under 400 when navi 42 launches and we will have some 8700xt that performs the same launch at the street price of the 7800xt.
