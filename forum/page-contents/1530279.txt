 Today when I started my laptop it just wouldn't start, stuck on the dell logo. I tried restarting it multiple times but to no avail, the thing just wouldn't boot. When I unplugged the charger and tried starting it, it ran the system tests which start by themselves after detecting that the computer has been restarted multiple times, this is where I received this error message (attached photo). After some googling I found that this particular issue is related to the ssd. I have 2 nvme ssds installed, the accused came preinstalled and I installed the other one myself just for some more storage. I think the problem is with the preinstalled one because I am having trouble booting into windows. If I have it plugged into the wall, it just gets stuck on the dell logo and if I turn it off, unplug, start and wait for several minutes, the computer finally boots into windows. I am writing this on the same machine. I have ordered a replacement, a crucial p3 (same as the other one) but I want to know if I really need that and if this is maybe some software thing? This laptop is a gaming machine (I do game pretty heavily on this) which I also use for college work and this is only 2 years old (bought in 2021, dell g5 5505). Please help me with this issue, if you need anymore info please feel free to ask and please help me get to the bottom of this. Thank you very much for reading.
 Sounds like your stock boot SSD is failing.
  If you can get the laptop to boot off that drive, do not shut it down until you have backed up any irreplaceable data you care about. 
    If you're not sure whether or not your laptop is under warranty, enter it into Dell's support site. That will tell you. If you're under warranty, you might be able to get another drive. If not, then install the Crucial SSD you bought and do a clean Windows install on it.

thanks for your reply, as soon as it booted up I quickly backed up my data. My laptop is not under warranty and I will do a fresh windows install on the new one. Just wanted to know if this thing is salvageable or not, could this thing happen due to frequent overheating of the system?

hey, so, that replacement drive just arrived and after I put it in to install windows, go to the boot options to select the usb stick and after I do that, an underscore appears on the top left followed by a dell logo which then disappears only to reappear again in a few seconds. I thought if maybe I could start up the old drive again to directly install windows on the new drive but when I plugged it in and opened disk management, I see the same drive I had in the 2nd slot before (there's only two slots). I though maybe I put in the old p3 by mistake but when I swapped it with the new p3 it still had the same drive letter, files, everything just the same. Can you please tell me what is going on?
