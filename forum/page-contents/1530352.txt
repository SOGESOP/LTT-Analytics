 Summary
BMW in 2020 thought they could place hardware in cars and then, as they claim, on an as-needed or continual basis you could pay for a subscription service to enable your seat heaters. 
  Now, while they claim that the customer isn’t paying twice, the initial cost would have to be baked in somewhere right? 
  They still intend to continue offering software based subscriptions, but not any relating to hardware.

First announced in 2020, the subscription was intended to be one of many ways to offer flexibility to customers, who could opt in to pay for vehicle functions when it suited them, then stop paying when they were no longer wanted.
…
BMW found customer uptake for the heated seats subscription was not high, Nota said, adding: “People feel that they paid double – which was actually not true, but perception is reality, I always say. So that was the reason we stopped that.”

  My thoughts
This was a dumb idea to begin with. I could maybe, MAYBE, see if it was a one-time fee to activate them if you didn’t necessarily pay for them at purchase, but a consistent sub? That’s just silly.

 The article didn't touch on... What are they doing for those vehicles out there already? Will they just be activating these features? Or will those people have to pay to activate them? Is this policy retroactive? Just going forward? I think we can assume the answer but it would be nice for them to actually answer it.
 Never thought I'd see the day... Then again, I was never expecting them to ever do something like this to begin with... Gatekeeping already installed hardware... lol
  That's modern companies for you I guess.

Good point
 This is why we can't have nice things... BMW had a very cool consumer friendly solution but all the "pro consumer" activists totally took the solution out of context and made it seem like a bad deal for the consumer, because that's how these activists get attention and funding, so now the best case scenario. Now everybody has to pay for heated seats, whether they want them or not. How is that a better solution?

Not sure if sarcasm or you're serious...
It's not a one time fee, it's an ongoing payment and if you don't pay you don't get heat and if you want it you pay for it for the life of the car. How is that "pro consumer"?

Ah yes because historically people who are buying a BMW want to be able to save money on a car by locking a piece of hardware behind a subscription rather than a one time payment. You realize that the subscription model only works if the people who pay for the heated seats cover the cost increase of all cars including heated seats? Also keep in mind that heated seats probably aren't all that much in terms of cost compared to the whole vehicle and honestly heated seats should be standard anyways on a luxury car like a BMW.

So you just read the article and not the original BMW terms I guess? 
  As someone who actually read the terms from BMW:
You could always order the car with heated seats permanently enabled, for a one time fee, just like you always could.
Or you could decide to get a small discount, order the car without heated seats, but the car still comes with the hardware for heated seats, they're just disabled. This makes sense for BMW because then they only need to manufacture and stock one type of seats, and they found a way to make money after the sale of the car. If you chose this route, you can still at any point make a one-time payment to enable the functionality permanently. Or you can enable it on a subscription for months at a time, if that is something that makes sense for you. Or you can decide to not use the heated seats at all, and pocket the money you saved when ordering the car. This is great, because while you might not see the need for heated seats, when you try to sell the car, the new owner might want to, so they can just purchase the heated seats, which greatly increases the resale value.
  But activists want to force BMW to physically remove something you didn't pay for from your car, so you don't get the feeling that you paid for it anyway and don't get to use it. Do you really think this will make the cars any cheaper? Well I got news for you...

  here I have a screencap for you. Heated seats are the equivalent of £15 per month. It’s worth noting that customers can also pay for a £150 ($178) yearly subscription, £250 ($296) three-year subscription or buy the heated seat functionality permanently for £350 ($414).

If you want them permanently just buy the Unlimited package, if you want them every once in a while then what's wrong with a subscription? If you don't want them at all, what's the problem?

The problem is its arbitrary, where there's seemingly nothing preventing it from being a native feature to the vehicle than as an anti-consumer continuous source of revenue. 
  Really a symptom of a fundamental problem, where a car company has no prosumer way to make continuous revenue without doing something scummy. Outside of predatory warranty programs or leasing, what possible source of revenue could a company make out of a car than unnecessary subscription programs?
  Otherwise, you're hoping to reinvent the wheel enough each year to incentivize people to make a poor financial decision and likely replace a perfectly functioning vehicle "because they feel like it". It's not like my 2017 Tacoma TRD will ever need to be replaced outside of part failure that eventually isn't worth it, which can go for decades if you keep up preventative maintenance and have some luck.

Per owner though IIRC.  I think you are overvaluing options, they really have very little value in the used car market. My daily driver that I use for commuting to work, would be a considered a "desirable" model, and according to the blue book value, the difference the heated seats make in private party value  is less than $300. Noting that this car is still also only a couple years old. That is still less than the "unlimited" charge for the heated seats BMW is charging.  When I sell this car to the next person and buy a replacement, the next owner just gets the heated seats, no charge to unlock the hardware that was already there.

If you want it to be part of the vehicle forever and not a continuous payment you can just buy the "unlimited" pack. This is the part that the media conveniently leaves out because it makes for a much more sensationalist story that you have to pay subscription fees for the heated seats. BMW never forced anyone to pay a subscription for heated seats, they merely offered it as an alternative to buying the heated seats outright. How is having options as a consumer a bad thing?
 This is the equivalent of on-disc DLC. Consumer perception will never accept it.

The heated seats in my car just work and will continue to work. What happens in these cars when they are "classics" and BMW has shut down the "activation servers" for these options? We've seen this over and over again for other things. They won't be up forever, and then none of this stuff will function. How long do you thing BMW will support this, especially as they've admitted it didn't go over that well in the first place?

Last time I checked, people are still free to buy whichever car and whichever model they see fit. Until someone sells modular cars, you are always buying a manufacturer-defined bundle of features, but no one is forced to buy heated seats if they don't want them.

The problem is no one was subscribing, so they paid the cost for all those heated seats and made little revenue. Despite all your mentions of "prosumer activists", no law was passed banning this practice, it was withdrawn by BMW itself. They tried something. There was no market for it. That's all that happened here.

...
Because its arbitrary, there's nothing other than anti-consumer gatekeeping preventing those seats from acting in their full capacity, without a subscription.
  Options are nice when they're not artificially created, in this case, it's entirely artificial and arbitrary on why that feature would be disabled. Its not like they're binning the chairs as they come in, figure out some of the heated seat functionality doesn't work, then deciding to disable that feature...
  If you can't understand why paying more for something that's you technically already bought for arbitrary reasons is anti-consumer, then clearly you're the consumer BMW is targeting.
  Hilariously cringe scenario here, having to justify why a heated seat subscription is anti-consumer... These companies would add subscriptions for every feature if they could. They'd love for you to own nothing and be happy with a continuous subscription instead.

^ Exactly, an entirely arbitrary and artificially created cost.

  I imagine people already willing to overpay for a BMW realized how ridiculous it was to pay a subscription for heated seats, so they didn't. Impressive achievement for BMW.
