 What phone is better? I will use the phone for messaging, light photography, light gaming and watching yt. I heard the iphone 11 only has a 720p screen? Not sure about that. Based on research (one google search) there cameras are both pretty similar but I could be wrong. I just want in terms of raw performance which phone out of these two are better for my use case. I think that would be the s21.

Thanks in advance.
