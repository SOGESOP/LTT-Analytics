 Hey guys, I have a 5950X. I'm currently running a X370 board and I'm considering an upgrade for PCIe 4 and better memory support. With a plan to upgrade to 64 or 128GB ram in future. 
  So, help me out? 
 Well, even though I have an X570 board myself, but first recommendation would be to consider whether you really need X570? Most people can get by just fine with a nice B550 board.

I am in need of PCIe Gen 4 on the whole board, and I don't believe B550 gives that?

  What do you mean by on the whole board exactly? X570 does have more gen 4 lanes, you can run two gen 4 NVMe drives on it compared to only one on B550 I think.

    More specifically Gen 4 on both x16 slots and for at least one M.2 slot 

To be clear, I'm not expecting them to both be x16 when running two GPUs. Which is why I'm wanting gen4. 
 Can only really offer my experience with my X570 Crosshair VIII Hero as I've had zero issues since AMD worked the early bugs out. Have been on it for 3 years.
