 Just upgraded my cpu thermal paste to Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (it was Arctic MX-4). Saw a MASSIVE drop in CPU temp. Went from 92° to 85° running Prime95 and upper 70s/low 80s CineBench to 65°.
  I am shocked.
 How long ago did you apply the MX-4? What CPU?
 What's the cpu post some specs.? & this could be also be a result in a lucky application method. Curious to know i use Artic Ice for the gpu low 20's on my rig i may use this as well for the gpu not only my cpu. Ddi you do the big dot or spread evenly ?

CPU is an AMD Ryzen 7 3700x. Applied old paste about Jan 2021, so prob around 19 months. I don't remember how it was applied but spread on AIO looked fine enough when I cleaned it. I manually spread the paste this go around.
 You probably did a better job this time around. Sometimes I've had crap mounts too and just reapplying thermal paste and reseating the cooler makes a big difference. Bc MX-4 isn't bad... the difference should not be this stark.
  But either way I'm happy for you!

Good to know for the future!
 That’s a big drop. I would the previous mount was lacking.
