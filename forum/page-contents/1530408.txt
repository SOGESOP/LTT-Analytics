It's a mass produced very generic, low end music player. It will play music. It won't be audiophile quality but it likely won't sound like a phone turned up too loud. Don't expect much, then you won't be disappointed.
 I'm sure it will sound perfectly alright and, maybe even decent.
  If you just want something alright then this is probably just that.

To masowo produkowany, bardzo ogólny odtwarzacz muzyki z niższej półki. Będzie odtwarzać muzykę. Nie będzie to jakość audiofilska, ale prawdopodobnie nie będzie brzmieć tak, jakby telefon był podkręcony zbyt głośno. Nie oczekuj wiele, wtedy się nie rozczarujesz.
Do you know what the sound of old music towers that are 20 years old is like? For example, the Philips MZ-7 music tower.
I want to have the sound that these old towers have, so what about the new ones would be at the same level?

Jestem pewien, że zabrzmi to doskonale, a może nawet przyzwoicie.
  Jeśli chcesz po prostu czegoś w porządku, to prawdopodobnie właśnie o to chodzi.
I wanted it to sound good, not too loud, it doesn't need to have strong BASS and a strong impact. I have speakers for PLN 150 CREATIVE Pebble Plus 2.1, which cost about USD 35, I can only hear the treble and some rumble, not even BASS, just some rumble.

Chciałem, żeby zagrało dobrze, niezbyt głośno, nie musi mieć mocnego BASU i mocnego uderzenia. Mam głośniki za 150 zł CREATIVE Pebble Plus 2.1, który kosztuje około 35 dolarów, słychać tylko górę i trochę dudnienia, nawet basu nie ma, tylko trochę dudnienia.
Or maybe buy car speakers and a car radio? I saw a very good sound in almost every car. I had a car radio at home, I connected speakers from an old music tower to it and it played very well, even too well.

I think you will get more midrange with the Philips one compared to the creative you have, probably more mid-bass too. These are just my guesses based on the specs though.

If you are going to but car audio stuff you are going to have to build cabinets or rip the interior out of a car. If you have access to a wood workshop and think calculating and designing speakers could be fun then sure, otherwise I would not go that route.
