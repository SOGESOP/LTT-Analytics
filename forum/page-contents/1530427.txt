 Hi, I'm about to build an ITX system with RTX 4090 and need an SFX 850W+ PSU. I've been using Seasonic for as long as I can remember. They have the best Customer service so far, they never let me down. So, I wanted to go with a Seasonic but I'm surprised. I couldn't find any high-power Seasonic SFX PSU in my country (Turkey) and Newegg. Does any 850+ W Seasonic SFX PSU exist?
 Seasonic does not have any 850W SFX power supplies. They only have SFX-L (larger than SFX) power supplies available up to 650W.
  There's not that many high wattage power supplies available in SFX form factor, the small size becomes prohibitive for the larger components needed for higher wattage power supplies like larger transformer, heatsinks, bulk capacitors, etc. Cooler Master has the V850 SFX, Corsair has the SF up to 750W in SFX form factor and up to 1000W in SFX-L form factor. Silverstone has a 1000W SFX-L power supply as well. Check whether your case supports SFX-L power supplies which are slightly longer than regular SFX power supplies and may not fit in many ITX cases.
 No. Doesn't seem like they have anything that goes beyond 650w. There is a very limited amount of 850W or higher SFX power supplies. Most people seem to go for the SF750, which will be enough for a 4090. And possibly even a 13900K given the max power for those is about 380-400W for the GPU and 250W for the CPU leaving about 100W for fans, motherboard and drives, but it's near impossible you're going to hit both the CPU and the GPU at the same time at 100% load, either way you could set a power limit of like 200W for the CPU, or you could go for a 7950X which has a max power usage of 213W but performs really well even when capped at 65W even in multi threaded workloads as can be seen below, although I'm not sure how good is that relative to the 13900K now.
 @AndreiArgeanu You're right, I think 650W is okay for gaming, and 750W is the sweet spot for future-proofing for gaming. But I'm a game developer and using Unreal 5 so, sometimes my GPU and CPU utilization both get 100%. That is why I'm looking for an 850W for future-proofing.

Then you might have to opt for a SFX L power supply if it can fit in your choice of case, since you canget a Corsair SF850, or opt for a Thermaltake or Cooler Master 850W sfx PSU. The Thermaltake Toughpower SFX 850W might be preferable since it has a 12VHPWR connector meaning you only have to run one small cable from the PSU instead of several 8pin ones which makes for a cleaner and easier setup. Or you can set some power limits without losing a great deal of performance or go for a 5950X/7950X if you haven't already bought your CPU and power limit that even lower and let the GPU rip and stick to an SF750.
