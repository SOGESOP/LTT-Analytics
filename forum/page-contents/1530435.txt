 I got a SSD and everything is well oiled up. I was wondering if these are good numbers since to me it feels like my restarts and boots are kind of slower than I expected based on my hardware.
 If you have 32gb of ram (or more)... its' fine.
I mean.. 11 seconds. You're trying to win a "boot race"?
 Mine is 15 seconds.
 Fast boot nowadays are in the 12-15sec range, with a M2 NVMe and a recent CPU
Most variance seems on BIOS post time with things like RAM training

As you install items that reside in the background or are in the boot cycle, this can be affected.
  A fresh Windows install is 10-12 seconds, and a fully set up machine is 15-30 or so in my experience.
  Don't forget that Windows will load apps even before you log into it.
