 Hello everyone,
  MY PROBLEM: I want to upgrade my GPU but I'm not sure if the power draw of new GPUs is going to be too much for my PSU.
  My PSU is a Seasonic M12II 620W. Been using it for roughly 5 years now, works great.
  I currently have a Ryzen 7 3700x and a GTX 1070 8gb, 16gb RAM, two SSDs, and some HDDs. The CPU has a default TDP of 65W (no overclock), while the GPU has a TDP of 150W and a suggested 450W PSU. This shouldn't amount to more than 250-300W total usage even under extensive load (gaming is the most heavy-duty thing I do on my computer).
  I'm thinking of getting an RX 7800 XT (TDP 263W) or possibly a RTX 4070 (TDP 200W). Now, these TDPs should fall well within the limits of my 620W PSU (the newegg calculator says the rtx 4070 should be fine), but the minimum manufacturer-recommended PSU wattages for these GPUs are 700W and 650W, respectively.
  Is there something I'm missing here? Since my PSU is getting a little long in the tooth, is it possible that it may have lost a significant portion of its total power capacity? Should I stick with lower TDP GPUs or can I safely install something like a RTX 4070 and not worry about it?
  Replacing the PSU is not an option at this time, as I don't feel like dishing out the extra cash or having to disassembling my whole PC to install it.
  Thanks for your input!
 Yes should be fine @GiganthraxMax amp 48A on 12V aka 576W (whole system) - according to this spec sheet:

 Its a very old design missing modern features but it should also be totally fine doing that
