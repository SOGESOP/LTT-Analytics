 Remove the gpu you do not need it in ny way shape or form
  Is that 16gb of ram total or 8?
  Psu sucks for something to last long get a quality unit
  As for cpu check how much a ryzen 5600g is its a lot better and usually just as much.
  A budget tower cooler for added silence would be a nice addition
