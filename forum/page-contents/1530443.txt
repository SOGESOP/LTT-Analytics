 Hey
  I'm currently looking into building a few new PCs.
Usually, we use mainstream platforms (either Intel or AMD) but recently, the 128GB RAM limitation is becoming "problematic" in some cases.
  I was considering using AM5 boards again but the manuals indicate that they only support up to 128GB of DDR5 which needs to be unbuffered (it can be ECC or non-ECC).
  I don't know if buffered/unbuffered is the same as registered/unregistered. It looks like its technically different but relatively similar. RAM specs generally mention (un)registered while MB documentation rather specifies (un)buffered...
  Now, AFAIU, AM5 platform can support up to 192GB (4x48GB) of DDR5 via a BIOS update, right?
  When I shop for DDR5 I can find modules up to 32GB in size easily. Then, there are the 48GB modules that are indicated as specific for the AM5 platform (I guess support on intel mainstream platform may be added in the future). Anything larger (64GB modules and up) is ECC, buffered, registered. So AFAIU I cannot use these on AM5.
  IIUC I should consider moving towards a proper "workstation" platform (threadripper pro for AMD, ??? for Intel), right? I am not familiar with these but I guess it must be pretty similar overall to mainstream platforms (I can still use Windows as an OS an conventional AICs/peripherals). These workstation platforms would support buffered, registered RAM modules. However, the price of other components (CPU, MB) is also exponentially higher AFAICT, right?
  Please let me know if I made a mistake or understood something wrong.
Any advice would obviously be more than welcome.
  Thank you very much in advance for your help.
  Best,
