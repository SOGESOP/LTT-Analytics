 i somehow managed to get the list of all the components i needed for rx6700xt build but i am a bit confused about my motherboard and processor as they are a bit confusing to choose taking my budget in account, i tried cutting down on ram and adding it on my motherboard but that is as far as i can go , i mainly need this for gaming and aiml, it will be a great help if you guys help me out from this thanks!!
i am attaching a document regarding prices of the components i am using in both inr and usd.
  total budget - 80000(964.59 USD) (all black)
                              build 1
monitor - 14100 (GIGABYTE G24F)(amazon)(170.01 USD)
processor - 7965 (Intel Core i3-12100F 12th Gen)(prime abgb) (96.04 USD)/ 
motherboard - 7500(asus prime h610m )( prime abgb)(90.43 USD) / 13481 (MSI PRO B660M-A DDR4 MOTHERBOARD)(vedant computers)(162.55 USD)
ram -1699( corsair vengeance 8gb)(20.49 USD)/  2919(corsair vengeance 16gb)(prime abgb)(35.20 USD)
gpu - 33000(6750xt 12gb)(md computers)(397.90 USD)
cabinet -5094(asus ap201)(prime abgb)(61.42 USD) / 4890 (lian li 205m)(modx computers)(58.96 USD)
storage -4150(wd green sn570)(vedant computers)(50.04 USD)
psu - 4200(corsair cv 550)(prime abgb) (50.64 USD)
total = 84839(1022.94 USD)( wit 8gb ram , faster storage,  b660m mobo)
total = 77709(936.97 USD) (with 8gb ram and prime ap201 case)
          = 78928(with 16gb ram) (951.67 USD)
(future proof till 14th gen)
b660m mobo - 13481 (MSI PRO B660M-A DDR4 MOTHERBOARD)(vedant computers)(162.55 USD)
wd sn 770 1tb -  5300(63.90 USD)
i5 12400f - 13000 (156.75 USD)
i5 13400f - 19500 (235.12 USD)
  i can wait for a few more months just to get better bang for buck pc
and can shift to amd to if it can provide better performance than i312100f.
Thanks
 Hi, welcome to the forums.
  Your list is extremely hard to understand right now, the way it's formatted.  It's confusing to follow which parts are for which build option. Are they both the same except the CPU and board? Could you maybe create a PCpartpicker list for each build so we can more easily compare them?

thanks ,  i will attach a pc part picker link to this
build 1
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vKWtpB
this was my 1st list, but seeing some people saying A mobos are not worth money 
i added some more components to choose from but these can sometimes get out of budget
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/htjHBL
here are the modification i did
price may vary as these are cheaper in US compare to india
you can see the 1st list to compare it a bit
 
 OK, first thing that jumps out on both lists is RAM. 8GB is straight up not enough, and you don't want to be running single channel regardless of the amount you have. 16GB (2x8GB) is basically the minimum for a gaming PC. 
  I definitely would get a B660 board and not an H610 one, but I'm wondering how you picked the MSI B660 board in your second list? Do you need wifi?

i would probably go a bit higher wattage on the psu side but other than that it looks fine

will i be able to upgrade to gen 14 i5 without upgrading my mobo after 3yrs?
and how much watt psu i should get?
the system is making only 403watts so i thought 550 would be more than enough

14th gen isn't out yet so we can't know for sure. Supposedly it's still going to be LGA 1700 socket. However, there's nothing to say they won't pull the shame shit they did with LGA 1151 and change the pin out so that new CPUs need new boards anyway.

  So are these the current Indian prices converted to USD?
  This will get you started but for this amount of money I'd really feel better about having a six-core CPU.

ye but for future upgrades it might not be so that's the reason why

  Expand  
yeh these are ind prices converted to usd
and yeah is know a 4core cpu is not that strong
but i cant add any more budget than this rn, if you tell me to wait for more months ,i can do that , i will upgrade my processor after 2 or 3 years , and till then i need something that can work pretty well in less amount,

oh thanks, can you tell me if an aio or air cooler worth it for 'f' series processors, will they increase any performance,
i heard some people talking that your processor can generate for performance if it gets enough cooling and sometimes processor cant show it full power because it reaches certain temp and start to throttle . Is it true?
if yes whats better aio or an air cooler i am trying to build an full white mesh pc build

f doesn't mean speed. It means it doesn't have an igpu
  For a 12100f I would go for the stock cooler

Get a tower air cooler like the ak400 or a 240 arctic liquid freezer ii

Overkill for a 13400f.
  Stock cooler would still be OK if you have to get by, or any 120mm tower air cooler you can get for ~25 USD.

if they wanted to get an aio I would recommend that one

About 80 degrees but that's still fine

They're on a budget so they don't need unnecessary stuff.
