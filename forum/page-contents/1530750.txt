 Do I need a crossover or can I connect subwoofer directly to my amplifier. Subwoofer is passive not active. Below I have attached some pics of subwoofer 
 Your amps built crossover is set too high, plus it likely does not have the jam to drive it properly.. so you would need a sub amp. If you want to try to drive it with what you have, then you will need a crossover too.
  Some older amps are awesome, but would likely need to be rebuilt.
 Amplifier data and connectors missing.

So I need a crossover for this. But if i connect it to my amplifier do sound get distort. My setup is one tweeter which has inbuilt capasitor so i will connect the tweeter and this subwoofer in parallel and comment to my amplifier.  Moreover they mentioned something like this speaker acts like a woofer too, What do they mean.

 Long story short
only with a passive crossover
only if you use this amplifier only for your subwoofer

It means that if you have a low powered amp, then you can use it as a mid range driver. But if you have the 70w RMS then you can use it just for bass.

So if my amplifier is 100w can I use this as a woofer or should I use a crossover?
 If its 100w @ 6ohm, then I would just use it as a regular speaker. 100w @ 4ohm I would use it as a sub.

My amplifier is 100w per channel 4-8 ohms 
 I would try it out. A lot depends on your enclosure too.. room, all that stuff..

So is it ok if I use it as a woofer or a subwoofer as per my convenience or if I make it a woofer it might distort on High volume?
