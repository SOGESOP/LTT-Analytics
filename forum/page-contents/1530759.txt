 I've just released a Starfield Tweaker tool that allows you to change hidden settings in Starfield game in just few clicks. No fiddling with INI files, no need to remember the names of tweaks, it's all in one place. For initial release, I've only included few verified settings and tweaks, but I will add more as I find and verify more of them. My favorite is of course the FOV one because it's almost insulting that game released in year 2023 doesn't have FOV controls. Now you can adjust it in just few clicks!
  Changelog for version 1.0 (Initial release):
Added option to disable Bethesda intro logo
Added option to disable waiting time before you can press any key to continue (by default you have to wait for Starfield logo animation to complete)
Added option to disable “Message of the day” in Main menu
Added option to enable Ray Tracing which slightly improves lighting and shadows
Added option to adjust FOV (Field of View) from default 70° up to 130° in 10° increments

  Enjoy!
 This is great to see from someone in our community. I’ll download it next time I fire up the game. 
  Thanks!
