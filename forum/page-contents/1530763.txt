 my build is in my signature, if I'm correct. I enable d.o.c.p/xmp in bios. I tried lower ram MHz still happens. thoughts what can be the issue? the build is about 3 yrs old i didnt use it for about 18 months. everything is up to date bios drivers etc. having this issue for the past couple of months. 
 Have you tried disabling "fast boot" options in the BIOS? I also had that issue until I disabled those settings for RAM in my BIOS (R9 5900X with MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi).
  It does mean that my system takes longer to boot, but it now always boots without fail.
