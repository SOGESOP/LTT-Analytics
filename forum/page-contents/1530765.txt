 Hi,
  I recently bought a Gigabyte AERO OC RTX 4060 Ti 16gb from Amazon. When I plugged in the new GPU I've fresh installed de drivers using DDU and GeForce Experience, but the graphic card is not working at all (games run at 4FPS). GPU-Z shows at the "Bus" text: PCIe x8 3.0 @ x2 1.1
  Actually, that value doesn't make any sense. My previous GPU is a RTX 3060 12gb from MSI and GPU-Z shows at the "Bus" text "PCIe x16 4.0 @ x8 3.0".
  Is this GPU broken or something?
Maybe my mobo doesn't support this GPU? My mobo is MSI B450M GAMING PLUS.
 Latest mobo bios?
  Tried re-seating the GPU?

Latest version of BIOS installed.
I've removed the GPU like 4 times and every time the same result: 4FPS and sometimes the video output is flickering or drawing random lines looks like if you have plugged in the HDMI incorrectly

Yes, also tried this. I went to BIOS settings and changed "Auto" to "Gen3"

Can you try the new GPU in a different PC?

I will try to find another PC to test it out.
