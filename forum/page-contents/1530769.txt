 Hello everyone!
  Recently I finished a build in the Lian Li Lancool III, featuring a 420 AIO cooler. The case comes with 4x140mm fans, three front mounted, and one rear. Now, the issue is, I had to remove the rear fan to fit the AIO on the top of the case, and there's not enough space to mount it back. If anything, I'd need to get a 120mm fan. So, here's my question: would a rear fan in this confoguration meaningfully improve performance? Is it worth the trouble to get one?
  Any input would be appreciated, thanks!

no, when using AIOs it's mostly for looks (if you have an rgb one)
