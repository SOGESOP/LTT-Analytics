 For the past few months I have had multiple issues with my computer crashing and having BSODs. I have gone in depth about it if anyone cares to check the WinDbg analysis of the dump files. While playing Black Mesa, my computer crashed again, and when I turned it on, it went straight to the BIOS, as it failed to detect the primary NVME SSD where Windows was installed. On my previous post about my BSOD issues, many users pointed to the fact that the crashes were pointing to an issue related to the NVME drive (though they said it could have been caused by the motherboard too). 
  Now my computer stopped detecting my SSD, and I have no way of accessing my data. I wanted to test if it was an issue with the NVME slot or the drive itself, but I don't have a spare motherboard to test my NVME drive, and my current motherboard only has one slot. The drive is being detected on this current install of windows under Local Disk (E:), however, I can only access it by formatting it. Is there any possibility for me to test whether or not my SSD still works and if my data is retrievable?
