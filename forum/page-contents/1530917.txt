 Hello everyone, i will get into what i wanna say. I am in the military serving my time and our head guy there got a computer and he told me it's slow. I took it home, checked it, there was a bit of cigarette dust, cleaned that off, checked the CPU/RAM/System etc and the CPU it's got is an Pentim 4 640 single core and the motherboard is an ASUS P5VD2-VM with 3GB of RAM running Windows 10. Obviously it's not worth upgrading but oh well it's his computer and i'm gonna do what he says.  The motherboard supports upto 2 cores and i thought the best CPU for this would be the Pentium D 930. The CPU will be bought from EBay germany (i live in greece) because shipping is better than the US EBay. Now my question is, on some listings, it says in the title "SL95X", "SL94X" and "SL94R". Searching the 95 one brings up Pentium D 930 and searching the 94 brings Pentium 4 641 and the 94R brings the D 930 and it confuses me.  Does the Pentium D 930 have different names? If so, which is THE Pentium 930, SL95X or SL94X or SL94R?  Thank you!

 COMMENT_BREAK Having all the details you're looking for about Pentium D 930.Happens sometimes that... Intel deliver several SKUs for the same commercial name.

 COMMENT_BREAK OK, so this is a bit confusing because you start by saying you want the Pentium D 940, and then shift to talking about the 930. Which are you trying to buy?  TechPowerUp shows part numbers SL8WQ, SL94Q, and SL95W for the Pentium D 940: https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/pentium-d-940.c325  SL95X and SL94R are part numbers for the Pentium D 930.  SL94X is the Pentium 4 641.

Expand  Yeah sorry apologies, i meant the 930 and not the 940, fixed  Ahhh alright, gotcha, i understand  So i should completely ignore the 94X and only look for 95X and 94R correct?

 COMMENT_BREAK Better than some SSD brands that deliver same product code... for different PCBs and SSD spec.

The Core 2 Duos can handle Win 10 just fine, not amazingly but good enough. You do want to upgrade to at least 4 GB of RAM though and possibly an SSD if that fits the budget.

Anyway, the sweetspot would be E6600 - E6700 , the E6600 is less than $10 on eBay and E6700 seems to be around $15  They also have a low TDP, 65w, so should work with the cheapo vrm .... wouldn't use the 95w TDP pentium d 930 on it.       

 COMMENT_BREAK A few people are reporting across the web that the Q6600 works on this board, as does the E6700.https://www.cpu-upgrade.com/mb-ASUS/P5VD2-VM.htmlDo a bios update and drop in an E6700, Q6600 only if you either roll a larger downdraft Heatsink or are down for adding some vrm heatsinks. It’s survived this long with an 84w Pentium 4 HT but if anything was gonna die on that board, it would be the vrms after moving to a Q6600.  Either of those with the existing 3gb of ram, and ideally swapping to even a basic ssd, you could see reasonable modern use out of it. It would at least play YouTube videos and browse the internet in a better state than it does now.

The Pentium 930 is based on the older Netburst architecture and is power hungry (95w TDP) - the 640 was 84w TDP - so the cpu will consume more power.The E6600 or E6700 are 65w tdp so they'll consume less power , and are based on newer and better architecture Conroe , the e6700 is even made on newer process (45nm vs 65nm) making it less power hungry.

"I legit said that this is my owners computer."  They won't notice shit for a difference if you don't increase the RAM and keep the HDD.  It MAY be a touch faster, but barely polished turd.

PowerTechUp says SL9S7 and only that. Are the part numbers the same?

 COMMENT_BREAK It's same cpu,  SL9ZF is just a newer stepping, basically same cpu but fine tuning the manufacturing process allowed them to support a higher maximum voltage (1.5v compared to 1.3625v for the previous stepping) and some super minor tweaks that don't really give more performance  All codes except SL9S7 and SL9ZF are engineering or qualification sample, not guaranteed to work.  so tldr it doesn't matter which one you get, they'll work exactly the same.  Stepping S-Spec HH80557PH0674M BX80557E6700B0 QLLO +  B1 QPGA +  QPGB +  B2 QTOE +  QTOF +  SL9S7 + +SL9ZF + +Unknown QPEU +  QUJC +

Expand  Heyo, I'm back. So i bought the E6700 but it doesn't boot, it doesn't give me no beeps and it stays there doing nothing. Putting back the old CPU works just fine but the E6700 does nothing. BIOS update was already on it's latest version so i didn't touch the BIOS update but i see no life.  Faulty CPU?  To be honest, i haven't done any deep down troubleshooting, does the RAM affect the boot of the PC?

 COMMENT_BREAK Sounds like the CPU is dead,but you would need another motherboard to test it on to confirm it.

You may have a BIOS version currently in the board that doesn't support the chip you have because of that, causing the chip to act as if it's dead when it's not.You can try an older BIOS version to see if that's the case or not here.Be sure to try a BIOS file that states added support or supports the chip model(s) you have and see.If the board's BIOS chip is removeable you can do as I did with my old DFI.Since it DID have a similar model chip to the one you're trying that may not be the case here, esp if you know that chip (The system) was working but it's still good info just in case you want to run a newer chip later.

Expand  Alright then bud, i will try going back to an older BIOS version when i got time and i will get back to you with news. But the BIOS chip is not removable unfortunately so the only solution is going back to an older BIOS.  There are 2 BIOSes that say "Support for new CPUs" etc so i will try those and see what happens. If nothing works, well, I'm doomed.

Should also work with Wolfdale chips too (Core 2 Duo) such as an E8400 for example, those are better chips than the one you have now.

This computer has mismatched RAM. The RAMs that were in were the Samsung M378T953CZ3-CE6 (Slot 1, left) and the Kingston KVR800D2N5/2G (Slot 2, right) . Removing the Kingston one and leaving the Samsung alone made the computer boot up putting the Kingston in slot 1 where Samsung was, the computer has difficulty booting up, as if the Kingston is barely getting read so it boots up. It's 50/50  Putting Samsung in slot 2 and Kingston in slot 1, it doesn't boot, i'm baffled lol. Why does it do that? Maybe the CPU doesn't like mismatched RAM? Could you check it out please because i'm mingboggled lol.  I didn't think the RAMs would be an issue, that's why i didn't bother removing each one and see what's up. Sometimes the simpliest thing could cause the whole system to not boot, my days

 COMMENT_BREAK Samsung seems to be 667 Mhz, Kingston seems to be 800 Mhz  Manual says : Memory 2 x 240-pin DIMM sockets support up to 4 GB of  DDR2 667/533 unbufferred non-ECC memory  It's possible there was an option in the bios to manually set the memory at 667 Mhz and the previous person set that option, and then installed the kingston ram which probably forced the kingston ram to run at 667 mhz  With bios update, maybe that option was reset, or maybe with this new cpu this option may no longer work - and the board officially can't work the memory at 800 mhz

I did do a CMOS reset before i installed the new CPU and did the load default BIOS settings and maybe it's what you said but i do not understand why the system cannot boot up with the 2 RAMs but putting either one of the two boots up? I will try if possible to lower the speed of Kingston and see if that helps.  Also where did you find in the manual about the memory specificions of this CPU? Because I've been searching for the past 10m and i cannot find it, unless I'm dunb. Thanks lol
