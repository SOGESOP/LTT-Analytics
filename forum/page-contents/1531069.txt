 Hi  So i am currently on an ASUS ROG STRIX GTX 1660 SUPER and was thinking of upgrading.  I was looking at these GPUs:  - RTX 3060 Ti- RTX 3070- RTX 4070 Ti  I am also using this CPU - RYZEN 5 3600.  I am not sure if the RTX 3070 or RTX 4070 Ti will cause bottleneck for 1080p gaming so just wanted to ask which GPU should i buy ?

As @filpo says, you'll be wasting a 4070Ti until you upgrade the CPU.  Microcenter within a reasonable distance?  

 COMMENT_BREAK I would recommend a 7700XT. Will handle just about all 1080p games. Will run better than a 3070 and cost 2/3rd as much as a 4070TI.

Your call  If you are upgrading soonISH, get the 4070Ti.  If not for a few years, then get a 3xxx and then upgrade the PC as a whole in a some years.  No use spending now for something you can't fully take advantage of.

Jokes aside though im not sure i actually need something more than a 3060 Ti or 3070 for 1080p gaming.  Mainly because so far the current CPU is doing it's job.

All in all, either buy a 3080 second hand or 4070. since you want to go nvidia only.

 COMMENT_BREAK @Dedayog  BTW any difference between these brands : ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE ?  I was leaning towards ASUS however 1 of my current GPU's fans seems to have some issues - see my post above.  On the other hand i heard GIGABYTE has a bad rep with their customer service and back in june this year DIABLO 4 fried like pretty much every 3080 from GIGABYTE.  About MSI i don't really know how good or bad they are, i just know they're among the top brands along with ASUS and GIGABYTE.

Pretty much the reason why i wanna upgrade :  Expand  well yes for now, but even now its already clear 8gb is not going to be enough in the bigger titles soon. Which you also want to play of course. So while it may perform well now it isnt going to perform well in the long run. and of course if you have no problems turning settings down in those games to medium or using higher upscaling yea it probably wont be an issue. but would you really want to spend 380 bucks to do that? in my opinion its a bit of a waste of money.Yes dlss is superior to fsr. But its not as bad as it seems when both are properly implemented. I used fsr when i still had a 2070s without any issues. yes not as good but not as bad as a lot of people said it was. And now with a 6950xt i dont really miss dlss at all.Now your choices are to me simple,  either go with a 3070. have dlss, have that nvidia premium feeling. and have reflex. in the supported titles... and have better raytracing. But only have 8gb of vram which is 100% going to cause issues and already is causing issues in some games. (especially with raytracing) And you do not get the newest features like framegen.or buy a 4070 so you do get the newest feature like framegen. and have 12gb but you do need to spend 550 dollaroos on that. OR get a second hand 3080 which will have a bit more vram and a decent bump in performance over the 3070. OR get a 6750xt for less money than a 3070 while having more performance or equal. and 12gb but worse raytracing perf in heavier titles (not easy ones). and sacrifice the mwah better quality of dlss for a still okay fsr. But get the nice feature of fsr3 in the future and antilag+ in the future. or get a 7700xt for a bit more perf than a 3070 and have 12gb and have av1 and have access to antilag+ now and probably a bit better fsr frame gen perf or quality. but it does cost you about 70 bucks more than a 3070 new.all in all its your choice and your money. so choose well else you will have to upgrade at some point again soon.

(but its nvidia lets be honest here they havent been doing that in the last 5 ish years). zotac is from my knowledge decent. gigabyte just has that annoying fan ramp up issue that can be very random in regards to which sku or even cooler model it happens with.i personally would still rather go for a 6750xt if you look at 3070 pricing. or rather then just bite the bullet get a 4070 for the 12gb and not have to upgrade in a long as time if you absolutely want to stick with nvidia. But thats me  would be a bit of a waste as you could get the 7800xt for cheaper more perf and more vram. but thats much like the 4070 just overkill for 1080p. or get a 4060ti 16gb bad priced but at least you get framegen which is cool i guess xDbut a 3060 would still be okay at 1080p just dont expect amazing performance even at that resolution with max settings. cause its more of a 60-80 fps 1080p ultra card in the big titles.

(but its nvidia lets be honest here they havent been doing that in the last 5 ish years). zotac is from my knowledge decent. gigabyte just has that annoying fan ramp up issue that can be very random in regards to which sku or even cooler model it happens with.i personally would still rather go for a 6750xt if you look at 3070 pricing. or rather then just bite the bullet get a 4070 for the 12gb and not have to upgrade in a long as time if you absolutely want to stick with nvidia.
