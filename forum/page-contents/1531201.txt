 6900xt/6950xt, 4070ti, 7800xt would be my best bet for at that resolution

  Actually that resolution is closer to 4k than 1440p so i would say 4080/7800xt/7900xt

What's your psu, mobo and cpu cooler? I might get a 5800X3D on top of the new gpu
Try these new gpus

 the suggestions others gave are great but i want to remind you.

if you want to crank up the settings to max, and have a +100 FPS experience on that resolution and refresh rate, then I'd say go for the top, get the RTX 4090.

I'm also 144hz 1440p ultrawide user, and most demanding games it won't reach 144 fps ever, in cyberpunk with frame gen I get around 100-120 fps most of the time, which isnt bad given settings are all set to max.

but if you can settle for 60-100 fps medium-high settings in games then sure what others suggest is also acceptable.

but with a 4090 you'll truly get the experience of high refresh rate AAA maxed out games, the choice is yours. But I strongly recommend it because I am on a similar setup as you and I cant imagine a lower GPU for today's games, lower GPU would mean a lot less fps, going down from 4090 to 4080 would likely mean more than 30 less fps for me in most cases, which is night and day in smoothness in high refresh rate monitors.

anything thats at least 100% as good. so for you and because you choose this resolution i wouldnt put anything less than a 7900xtx/4080.

but if thats too high of a price, you can always get the 6950xt/4070ti but vram and the lack there of makes the 4070ti not worth it for its price in my opinion. so in my opinion 6950xt or 7900xt. or maybe a 3090/3090ti if you can find one second hand thats good
