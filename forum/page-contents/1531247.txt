 so, my boss' boss' son bought a laptop and it came with these, and I have no idea what they are.  (I only have the pic.)  WTF are they?  Laptop Stand?  Weird fan grills?

 COMMENT_BREAK Yeah i think this would be easier with more context, like a model of said notebook.They indeed very weird for a fangrill, they too open, but maybe thats like a 2nd option on said notebook?

But i cant give you even an educated guess.I could but ive been wrong before, and dont think giving another wrong answer will help you.Best of luck, lets hope someone knows exactly what they are.
