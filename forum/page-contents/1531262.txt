 New build with Gigabyte Aorus Elite AX Z790, RTX 4070 FE and i5-13600K CPU.

The PC boots, the fans spins, GPU spins, but I get no display via a DP through the GPU or the Mobo. Using a Dell S2721DGF from the last build that worked just fine on a 2060.

I've tried clearing CMOS, checking cable connections, etc.

Am I missing something?

Rest of build:
Trident Z DDR5 6000
Samsung 990 Pro
Fractal Celsius+ S24 AIO
Super Flower Leadex VII XG 1000W

 Did you remove the GPU when testing the motherboard port? Most boards will disable integrated video if a GPU is detected.

Will try this!
  Also, I'm so lost on how to properly connect the 4070? Currently using the stock adapter plugged into two 6+2 VGA's. Is that correct?
The PSU also came with its own 12VHPWR into VGA. Is scrapping the stock adapter and using the PSU's cable safe/recommended?

i would use the PSU supplied  12VHPWR connector,  the adapter is for people that don't upgrade their PSU's when they buy a new GPU as PSU standards recently changed.

 Turns out the old monitor I was using somehow broke internally during transport. Plugged in a new monitor and it worked perfectly. Thanks, all.
