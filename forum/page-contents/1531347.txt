 Tell me some Pros and Cons of Smartwatches.

 COMMENT_BREAK They're great if you plan to actually use them for their perks that they have over normal watches (health/activity tracking etc), but if you're just going to use it for basic time telling stuff, you're better off with a good quality analogue watch because it'll last you a lifetime.   (i got a gold watch for my 21's birthday and it's still going nearly 20 years later, but I'm on my 3rd smart watch and they haven't even been around all that long) 

 COMMENT_BREAK They loose value over time. Get the right watch and it increases in value. I bought an omega speedmaster back in the day, it has more than doubled in cost now, so if I was ever inclined, I'd make a healthy profit.

 COMMENT_BREAK I have a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar that I use for things like work outs, running, and other outdoor activities. An advantage is I don't have to pull out my phone to change songs or to check a message that came in. Like most phones, it can also be used as a tap to pay function in case I didn't bring my wallet with me. Battery also lasts for 7-10 days before needing to be charged, unlike most other smart watches. The disadvantage is that it's a connected device, so you're constantly being pinged if you don't set it up correctly. It's also clearly a smart device and they generally don't look very nice when you want to dress up. In those cases I'll just switch over to one of my analog watches as smart watches will never beat a nicely designed one in looks.  If you're just wanting a watch to tell the time, don't bother with a smart watch. For the price of my Garmin, there are a lot of really nice analog watches you can pick up for $1000 or even much less.
