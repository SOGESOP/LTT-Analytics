 hi i'm currently planning to gradually build my first ever pc from scratch. i have an ssd-upgraded legion y530 1050 ti i5 8300h laptop bought in 2019 and it's still a champ for work and some older games so i will continue to use it, but i can't deny it's nearing its course sooner or later especially for games and i wanna be prepared. though of course before buying the pc parts one by one over time i need to decide on them. however i've been going back and forth over my cpu and gpu choices that it's bugging me so much so i would like a second or third opinion from people who know more than me  Budget: around $470 USD (~Rp 7.2 million, for ease of reading i'll use USD) less if possible because i also need to save for a new phone but i don't want to sacrifice too much performance and upgradabilityCountry: indonesia, where every penny counts and where all your cash goes to shopee or tokopediaGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for: mostly emulated games and a few singleplayer AAA titles like baldur's gate 3 and the upcoming dragon age 4 in 1080p >60fps + light photoshop/premier use. i'm thinking my build should last around 6~8 years before doing more major upgrades after  the other parts i've decided (total ~$265):2x8gb ddr4 3200mhz ram (~$35)a550bn msi 80 bronze psu ($45)1tb m.2 nvme ($45)matx case + fans ($30)1080p 144hz koorui 24e3 monitor ($110)  for the remaining $205 i'm mainly considering a few options.  i would either have a ryzen 5600g + b550m (~205$) or a i3 12100 + h610m (~$187) to just get it up and running first when i eventually get the parts. then when my paycheck rolls in the months to come and pc part prices hopefully get even cheaper i'd be getting an rx 6600 (i found used ones for ~$130) or something higher to complete the build. if am4 then i have an upgrade path to the new 5800x3d, if intel then to whatever 14th gen will have to offer.  the third option is that i get the 12100f and a used rx 580 8gb (total ~$224) and use that for 1~2 years until i can get a better gpu later but it's kinda stretching my pocket here.  what do you guys think? is it wise to buy am4 brand new in 2023 when am5 is here or should i go with lga1700 for some futureproofing? should i sacrifice some other parts for the cpu/gpu? do you think with my budget maybe i should look at older gens? should i wait off 1~2 years and be content with my laptop before i build?  thanks so much in advance!

 COMMENT_BREAK Id get the 5600g as the issue with the 12100f is that it is the current MINIMUM spec to not have in game stuttering whilst only gaming.  Basically means needing an upgrade quite soon as the only things keeping this in check are the old consoles.  Can already see it with ps5/xbox series only games that fully load an 8 thread cpu and still want more

So no its not reallt the best investment especially since with going 12th gen you'll need to rather soon upgrade the cpu AND the gpu

Make sure to get one with a perforated/mesh front cause solid front cases have trash airflow and lead to trash temps    7 hours ago, vlebs said:1080p 144hz koorui 24e3 monitor ($110)Might be able to find better used monitors but not a peripherals guy so idk the diff between this and a used msi or asus monitor      7 hours ago, vlebs said:i would either have a ryzen 5600g + b550m (~205$)Used mobo will save abit here and go for a 5600 instead of a 5600g as you wont need the igpu and the 5600 has more cache  Tray 5600 1.7jtB450 tomahawk 925rb  Saved 400rb ish and you have both a better cpu and a better mobo (lemme guess some crap b550m like the hdv or the b550mh or maybe even one of those galax b550m with basically useless bios with no tuning options)    7 hours ago, vlebs said:rx 6600 (i found used ones for ~$130)Gpu wise used 6600 is a good choice at 2jt ish, if you need to save some money gtx 1070 usually go around 1.5jt    btw regarding those oem rams they will need to be tuned but all you really have to do is set some lazy primaries and voltage values like 3800/4000 18-22-22-22-56, trfc 300, 1.5v dram volt, 1.15v vsoc (for 8gb sticks trfc 300, trfc auto for 16gb sticks, likely around 500-600) and forget the overclock, just need to test with prime95 largeffts for 15-30mins to make sure they arent unstable (at such slow speeds ram oc is usually set and forget so once stablized itll likely be fully stable not half stable or something)  essentially you have a ddr4 3800/4000 kit for dirt cheap with even better performance than said 4000 bin because double sided (dual rank), technically all the aformentioned models/ics can do 4600+ but youll need a 5500/5600g or desync fclk to run that speed and ram oc gets painful at high freq >4600 so just run sync fclk and youll be fine

 COMMENT_BREAK I can tell you baldurs gate 3 runs great on my system with a rx 570  but I'd be reluctant to recommend it because with just 4 GB vram new games have a hard time (ex the last of us, and others that stream a lot of content)with a 8 gb vram card rx 580 you may get some more life but it would still be better to go for something newer with at least 8 gb vram .... but not sure what would that be in your budget.  I would suggest giving up on that monitor, spend like 50-70$ on a 22-24" 1080p monitor and use the money for better video card  The B450 chipset mobo for cheap is a good advice. You could reuse the ssd from the laptop and delay buying a ssd, but that would make your laptop unusable (unless you can find some cheap 128 GB ssd to put in the laptop)
