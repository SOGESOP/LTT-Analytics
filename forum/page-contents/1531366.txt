 Budget (including currency): N/ACountry: UKGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for: GamingOther details New build  I'm very undecided on whether the 7600X or 7800X3D is the correct choice for the new PC build that I'm going for. The CPU will be paired with a 7800XT GPU and will be playing most games at 1440p on a 165Hz monitor (34" widescreen, so more like 3k monitor) (from which I understand there is less reliance on CPU).  I can get the 7600X for £180, or the 7800X3D for £300. My question is whether the extra £120 is actually worth it? The build is currently at ~£1.3k with the 7600X, which includes:- B650 MSI Gaming Pro Wifi Mobo (£150)- 32GB Lexar White ARGB Ram (£105)- ThermalTake GF1 80+gold (£70)- 7600X (£180)- 7800XT Sapphire Pure (£540) - on pre-order, still waiting- Crucial P5 2TB SSD (£76)- AIO Thermalright Frozen Notte (£68)- Case + fans (£105)  My main use for the PC will be gaming at 1440p (and preferably VR games as well through the Quest 2 which is technically a higher resolution), but I'm assuming I'm going to be GPU bound in nearly all cases rather than CPU bound, and therefore is the extra performance of the 7800X3D "wasted" as the 7600X will be just fine?  Would appreciate people's thoughts.

And what's your budget for the whole build?

 COMMENT_BREAK 6 cores are fine still today for gaming but if you ever want to do say video production or anything more cpu intensive in the future then you will wish you got the 8 core.  That being said how long will 6 cores be acceptable for gaming? im not sure

The only indecision I have is the CPU, therefore would you be able to provide some thoughts on this?  Thanks

I might get a 7600 instead of a 7600x since it has the same performance but at a much lower power budget and temps

I might get a 7600 instead of a 7600x since it has the same performance but at a much lower power budget and tempsI'm going with the AM5 platform with the expectation that at some point, I may have the possibility of upgrading my CPU if that is becoming the bottleneck / I would like a stronger performing CPU. If I go with the 7800X3D, this "upgrade date" is pushed further in the future, and depends how strong a performance the last AM5 gen CPU puts up (whenever that may be).  I "might" upgrade the GPU in the future, however I don't anticipate doing so for at least 6+ years, given that the 7800XT is brand new  7600 vs 7600X is a decision I have already made - they are basically the same chip therefore whichever is cheapest, which for me was the 7600X. 7600X running in ECO mode is a 7600, and 7600 with overclocking is a 7600X. The decision is between the 7600X and 7800X3D.

I suspect with all the UE5 games coming they will also as its a very CPU heavy engine.

You want to push back the hypothetical upgrade date or not?  Also how much is the 7600x you found because the 7600 non x is £30 cheaper on overclockers.co.uk and both come with starfield

But they also are more efficient, PCs have more overheads so I think 6 cores is quickly going to become a limiting factor on modern games.    5 hours ago, filpo said:But you could just do this in the futureSince you're not gonna be upgrading your gpu and monitor for so long and you're only gaming, there won't be any uplift for going to the 7800X3D.

Looks like it's a split vote from what I can see, no wonder I was finding it hard to decide!

If you're not willing to spend the extra money, then the 7600x is a better value. You're not getting 66% extra performance with the 7800x3D to make it a good 'value', but it is the best gaming CPU you can buy right now.
