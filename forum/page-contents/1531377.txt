 On the market for a new headset, I've used my Bose NC700 as headset up to now but it's not good for communication (BT only..), battery life is short (17hrs max on mine, it's 2 years old), and it's not very comfortable  on long sessions, with my big head and glasses,  too much pressure on ears and around
I'm not a FPS guy, play mostly BG3 and TWW3 atm, and use Discord for comms
Read/watched reviews and narrowed my choice to 2 models (price isn't an issue)
Logitech G Pro X2 : good overall, will mingle well with my Logitech KB+M environment, but poor mic. Also the only one I can get in white as my whole setup+desk is white themed !
Audeze Maxwell : rated "best" by more reviewers, maybe better all around, but can't find it anywhere in Europe and can't ship one from Amazon US..
I think I'd just go for the Logitech, but should I rather wait a bit to get a Maxwell ?

 Corsair HS80 has a decent microphone and it's also wireless.
HyperX Cloud II wireless and other Cloud wireless have decent sound.
  If it doesn't need to be wireless, there are way better options.

    Get the maxwells. Do NOT get Logitech or any other of these gaming brands' headphones. https://youtu.be/F70rCTSeZ3Q?si=z1nldl_-fx1V03cW&t=178

 If wired is an option I recently upgraded to a PC38X from HyperX clouds. Really good, can recommend but maybe might be awkward for bigger than average ears, though I never hit the pretrusion.

 What about this store?

Want wireless, got a 0 cable setup
HyperX seems good to but I really dislike their looks...
As for Corsairs I'm not fan of this brand and their dreadful ICUe bloatware, still will look at the HS80 and Virtuoso but seem they compete in a lower category (at least price wise.. )

The guy says the Maxwells are great but doesn't compare them to others, and in reviews that do Maxwell/Hyperx/G Pro X are considered all good choices, why shouldn't I buy one of them ?

  Expand  
Maybe the Sennheiser / Epos wireless like the GSP 670 or 370?
  I know that Logitech (and Astro), Razer and Steelseries do not care about the sound quality (and are terrible for any type of competitive gaming), so I can't recommend them.

    There are two versions, one for XBOX and one for PS5. I assume, that they work best with the respective console for things like volume control. I'd assume they both work on PC, but I would look up what Audeze writes about that themselves.

why not? Mine were pretty decent and lasted quite a long time.

Thought the same about "gaming" headsets for long (crap sound), but those high tier new gen headsets seem to have good enough sound so that even audiophiles find them ok
Things sometimes progress in the right way

  You're not wrong and I kind of worded that too aggressively against gaming headsets. But you can get other headphones/headsets worth your money than Logitech. Especially when the Audeze Maxwells were brought up.

Yes, but again, you can get more for your money and I would never again support a gaming brand that just markets the shit out of normal headphones and calls it "gaming 7.1 surround" or calls the drivers "triforce drivers" or "graphene" or whatever depending on the brand. In reality just support audio brands and not keyboard/mouse manufacturers.

that's a real thing, I've felt it myself, though I haven't tried if it's just "really good sound magic" with different headphones on same size driver (because if you use dongle to connect Sony headphones, the program still thinks it's Logitech, which allows you to turn on surround 7.1)

Yeah of course you can connect ANY headphone that has a 3.5mm cable since it is an analog connection which doesn't matter which source you use it will still make sound. But 7.1 surround is not achievable in headphones because, believe it or not lol, the driver on each side is too close to your ears. Virtual surround is a thing that you mean and doesn't sound very good at all and more often than not worsens directional audio and quality because it becomes mushy and congested. And speaking of surround in headphones. Razer tried that with the "true 7.1 surround" headset Razer Tiamat which failed horribly due to having like 5 speakers in one cup making the sound more confusing and weak due to separate and multiple drivers.

in my experience only slightly worsens the sound while actually doing the promised surround
  I'm not saying the headphones themself have 50 speakers inside them, but enabling the surround did feel like something was different, and for the first few weeks or months or so I've been using it regularly (daily) in games

I do feel something different as well. The feeling is bad quality with even worse imaging of the sound. Trust me, I've had Corsair, Logitech, Razer and all of them have sounded mediocre at best when it comes to quality and directional audio. If you have good headphones. Turn off virtual surround and use the games' binaural 3d processing of the sounds which is all you need. If the game doesn't have that. Use normal headphone settings with stereo mode without any processing of the sound. Because that is what your ears are, stereo aka binaural not 7.1 ears. 7.1 works with 7 speakers in a larger room where sound is actually distinguishable where it is coming from.

I don't use surround since my Logitech headphones are not working right. And I haven't for several years when they did work, however that's mostly because I listen to music when I game, and while the surround did feel like it was doing something the sound quality carried over to music, which wasn't always pleasant.
