 On the market for a new headset, I've used my Bose NC700 as headset up to now but it's not good for communication (BT only..), battery life is short (17hrs max on mine, it's 2 years old), and it's not very comfortable  on long sessions, with my big head and glasses,  too much pressure on ears and aroundI'm not a FPS guy, play mostly BG3 and TWW3 atm, and use Discord for commsRead/watched reviews and narrowed my choice to 2 models (price isn't an issue)Logitech G Pro X2 : good overall, will mingle well with my Logitech KB+M environment, but poor mic. Also the only one I can get in white as my whole setup+desk is white themed !Audeze Maxwell : rated "best" by more reviewers, maybe better all around, but can't find it anywhere in Europe and can't ship one from Amazon US..I think I'd just go for the Logitech, but should I rather wait a bit to get a Maxwell ?       

 COMMENT_BREAK Corsair HS80 has a decent microphone and it's also wireless.HyperX Cloud II wireless and other Cloud wireless have decent sound.  If it doesn't need to be wireless, there are way better options.

 COMMENT_BREAK If wired is an option I recently upgraded to a PC38X from HyperX clouds. Really good, can recommend but maybe might be awkward for bigger than average ears, though I never hit the pretrusion.

 COMMENT_BREAK What about this store?https://www.proshop.de/?s=Audeze+Maxwell

I know that Logitech (and Astro), Razer and Steelseries do not care about the sound quality (and are terrible for any type of competitive gaming), so I can't recommend them.

I assume, that they work best with the respective console for things like volume control. I'd assume they both work on PC, but I would look up what Audeze writes about that themselves.

But you can get other headphones/headsets worth your money than Logitech. Especially when the Audeze Maxwells were brought up.    3 hours ago, podkall said:why not? Mine were pretty decent and lasted quite a long time.Yes, but again, you can get more for your money and I would never again support a gaming brand that just markets the shit out of normal headphones and calls it "gaming 7.1 surround" or calls the drivers "triforce drivers" or "graphene" or whatever depending on the brand. In reality just support audio brands and not keyboard/mouse manufacturers.

 COMMENT_BREAK   50 minutes ago, Tigerleon said:"gaming 7.1 surround"that's a real thing, I've felt it myself, though I haven't tried if it's just "really good sound magic" with different headphones on same size driver (because if you use dongle to connect Sony headphones, the program still thinks it's Logitech, which allows you to turn on surround 7.1)
