Problem:  For the last two or three graphics driver updates (via GeForce Experience), the screen goes black (as usual) but then I can hear something changes with the fans and then after waiting a while I get a BSOD (see attached image). I have no idea what causes it. It is only when I update my drivers that it does this.   The only other weird behaviour that I see with my PC is sometimes after I close Path of Exile my computer often lags a lot and is super slow. That may resolve itself eventually but usually I shut the computer down then.  Any idea what could be the issue? Should I be worrying about my hardware? Should I reinstall windows?   

 COMMENT_BREAK I'd recommend trying to reinstall your drivers fresh.  Here's what I'd recommend trying. Go in to Safe Mode and run the DDU tool to completely uninstall all traces of the drivers https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/DDU-Guide-Tutorial then while still in safe mode attempt to install GeForce Experience and the drivers again.

 COMMENT_BREAK I'd also recommend ditching GeForce Experience and using NVCleanStall to install only required stuff (first four things).
