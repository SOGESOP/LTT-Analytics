 Hello guys thanks for giving me a handI want to buy a second monitor stand for 27inch vesa 100x100 monitor.This one: https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B08XY8BJDS?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_shareI want to use this monitor in vertical position I already bought one stand, but because the monitor is very bottom heavy, it doesn't stay vertical and the monitor falls down, I need one that has a strong pivoting mechanism.This is the one I havehttps://amzn.eu/d/afd3i74It can't have a clamp because of my desk shape.Please recommend me a good one

 COMMENT_BREAK Can you get a mount that doesn't pivot, then install the monitor rotated 90 degrees?

 COMMENT_BREAK Also find one where max weight is above the weight of the monitor.(And also keep in mind they lie about max weight sometimes, so get your salt ready)

 COMMENT_BREAK If you don't really need the up&down tilt, a tube of epoxy glue will help.      Anywayyy.@VIVO-US still alive?  care to chime in ?
