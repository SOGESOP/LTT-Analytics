 so here we have what i built for my little sisters birthday. its equiped with an i5 4570 8 gb of 1333 mhz ram and a gtx 750. which makes this pretty competent for light games. it also already came with a 128gb ssd which as far i can tell is decent enough for what she would do with it. as you can see its based on an older optiplex with not to much power bugdet and that really slimmed down my choice of ultra cheap graphics cards.

 COMMENT_BREAK It's what?    Is it me or does it look like the forum is cutting of part of the text, as when i went  to quote there was more. @LogicalDrm Maybe you know?
