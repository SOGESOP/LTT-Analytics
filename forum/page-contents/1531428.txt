 So I have ASUS PRIME B450M-K with 3 1200 Ryzen and I'm upgrading to 5 5600 Ryzen
  I am not 100% sure of my current bios version, it might be 2006, if I need to I can quickly restart to bios and take a picture.

also, is installing a tower cooler as simple as installing the stock cooler?

 What you have to do is find the BIOS list, and if it was required to update to a specific version it'll say so in one of the BIOS revisions listed. From my initial reading of it, there is no BIOS revision that says "update to version XXXX before proceeding" so you should just be able to jump to the latest, though double check just in case I missed it.

what? That doesn't make any sense. How do you install both a stock and tower cooler?

It's what changed in the BIOS. With the way AMD BIOSes work, there's a closed source binary blob that handles a lot of what's related to CPU support, memory support, PBO, etc. called the AGESA. This latest BIOS updates that blob to ver. 1.2.0.A.

It means the BIOS update will also update AGESA to version 1.2.0.A. It is not an instruction to the user, even though it reads like one.

Yes, exactly

Can be, some mount the same way, some mount into a backplate or other supports.
  None are hard, so just get it done.

    aight, I'll bother you ETA 5-10 minutes if I won't figure it out myself
  but first, time to make use of my 600ml air duster

He was asking whether the installation procedure for a tower cooler has the same difficulty level as installing the stock cooler. Not that he wanted to install both at the same time
  I'd say it depends on the cooler, but generally no more difficult.

Sure, but it's really easy.  If you can build a PC, you can install a CPU Cooler in your sleep.

Clean cloth.  Dampen it a little with water, wipe til the paste softens enough to wipe off.
  Same way you clean dried sauce off your kitchen counter.
  The CPU is NOT fragile.  You just don't want to wipe anywhere NOT the heatspreader.

No, there are additives in that.  Water is just fine.
  Don't go getting creative.  
  Literally it's a paste that can be wiped off with a paper towel, done it a few times.
