 im gonna start uni soon and am searching a laptop. however there are a lot of options out there so need some help of recommendation.
I have the main specs out:
I7 11th-13th gen.
16gb RAM.
min of 512gb ssd.
14" screen minimum.
Im studing software engineering.
prefered with Ethernet (RG54).
 iwant something not too pricey. somewhere in the range of 900-950usd maximum. i can go to 1000 but thats a bit too much.
thanks for any who answers :).

 should it be on the lighter side or can it be a bit more chunky. Do you need good batterie life or just something portable? And one last question: do you want a dGPU? (for maybe some gaming on the side, or maybe even some other Programms take advantage of a GPU (i dont know im just a chemical engineer))
