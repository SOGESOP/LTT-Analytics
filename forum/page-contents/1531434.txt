 So I spent about an hour and a half deleting and checking files to clear space on my ssd. After a while I notice even windows says I have 60gb of installed apps even though I have all of my games on my hdd not my ssd. The only apps on my ssd are:
  -discord
-xbox app
-obs
-steam
-ea, ubisoft, riot and epic games app launcher
-cap cut
-geforce experience
  I don't know if my ssd is corrupted or something.

 is windows itself saying things are installed or is it the capacity is lower than you expected? is this your primary drive?

 if windows is saying you have 60GB worth of apps installed, windows is probably just wrong.

 Where are you getting this number from? What program is telling you that you have 60GB of Apps installed?

 Lol

 What does the Disk Management show? Also if partitioning is OK, then WizTree helps to locate big files.
Actually considering the original description the disk management should be fine.
