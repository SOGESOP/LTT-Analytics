 I have a Ryzen 5 pc, Has a B450M-A Motherboard with a ryzen 5 2600, a RX 480 8gb, 16gb of 3000MHz DDR4 with a EVGA 500W 80Plus gold PSU.

Today i currently have tryed disconnecting everything from the motherboard. the PSU connectors, the GPU the CPU Power connecter, the CMOS battery, the RAM.
Tryed a differant PSU thats another 500w its some dell obm psu but can be plugged in normally to the motherboard and gpu at least. and still get nothing.

no boot screen, my keyboard and mouse wont even light up. im completely out of options as to how to get this 3 to 4 year old pc to work.

Any help would be much apprechated

 Tried to swap the motherboard? I’m stupid and I can’t think of any other reason…

 Btw are there any status LEDs or beeps or anything suggesting the system has any power?
