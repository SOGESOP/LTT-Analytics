 Hi. Was just wondering what cards would be best for someone looking to build something but without the cash for a new card. From my own observations, i'm seeing 1660's, 5600's, 5700's and a couple 2060's. A couple of Vega cards too. Already got a 5600xt for like $120 but what other cards would be really good value for the price?

 I’d pick up a used rx 5700 xt. It’s from 2019, has quite a bit more vram and power than say the gtx 1660 and you can get the 8 gb oc version for less than 200 bucks.

 Depends on what you're gonna use it for.

Would be pretty cool to play the latest games at 1080p - even at medium/low settings. And I know the processor also plays a big role here, so let's say something like a i3 - 12100
