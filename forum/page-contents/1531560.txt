 I just saw a few minutes ago that ltt live has gone 

 COMMENT_BREAK Appears to have been brought down 12 minutes ago as of writing this.  That timestamp is pretty funny.     I do know that this was an experiment with YouTube to create "live channels" for some popular YouTubers, similar to cable TV. Perhaps that ended? 

 COMMENT_BREAK Too bad it was not visible before it ended

 COMMENT_BREAK Just came here for this, often had it on for background noise, so I was probably one of the few that enjoyed it being on. Hopefully it returns via LMG Clips
