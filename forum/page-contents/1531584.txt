 Hey LTT community,
  The brilliant and extensive LTT rig building YouTube guide brought me here.
  I’ve always steered away from hardware as I've never really gelled with it, and for most of my adult life I've needed a mac for work purposes. However, recently I’ve had the hankering to build my own rig and I’ve finally raised the budget for it, so am now at the planning stage.
  I was hoping some of you hardware veterans could have a look over my planned components, and let me know if you see any rookie mistakes or red flags, and if you have any cost-saving suggestions. I should mention that I'd take performance over looks, and would happily sacrifice RGB and fancy aesthetics if it meant better performance or reduced cost.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated - thank you! 
  Budget (including currency): £1500 - £2000
  Country: UK
  Games, programs or workloads that it will be used for: 
Mainly a gaming PC. I mostly play immersive solo games rather than fast paced e-sports or FPS etc. I used Baldurs Gate 3’s recommended specs as a starting point to build my component list, as that and other games like Starfield and Warhammer Total War 3 will be on my list to pick up (plus I want to finally play modded Oblivion after years of being on macOS).
  I will also need to do work on it. I work remotely and the most intensive software I'll need to be able to run is Adobe design software, Logic and Blender.
  Other details (existing parts lists, whether any peripherals are needed, what you're upgrading from, when you're going to buy, what resolution and refresh rate you want to play at, etc): 
I have a wireless USB mouse and headphones...and that's it!  I'm planning on picking up a basic keyboard and Windows 10 Professional, as my work is Windows based, it’s going for very cheap right now, and I'm pretty sure it’s a free upgrade to Windows 11.
  Monitor wise, I will eventually need two monitors for work purposes, but I'm fine with one for now and for gaming I'll only need a single monitor. For the size and resolution, I have no size limitations and I figure a 27" 2560x1440 monitor is a good starting point. I don't know much about refresh rate, but I've been told I should be aiming for at least a 144Hz HDR monitor.
  I'm currently opting for a DAC rather than a dedicated sound card (which isn't included in the component list below).
  I'm planning on buying all of this within the next two months, either in one or two instalments. I have a work colleague who is from Hong Kong, and whose husband is travelling there in October. They've very kindly offered to pick up some of my components there if I'd like, since apparently PC parts are more accessible and drastically cheaper than they are in the UK. Asides from the BIOS likely not being in English, are there any other reasons why this might be a mistake over purchasing all the parts domestically?

 I would opt for a higher end cooler, like the NH-D15. Everything else seems to be good. Why buy a DVD copy of Windows? Collecting the packaging? Or do you like DVD drives (I sure do)?

Thanks for the reply - I'll check out the NH-D15!
  Regarding the Windows 10 DVD, it's just how it came up on PCPartPicker - it'll actually be a digital purchase. I believe this means I'll need to flash install it, but could be wrong there!

Thanks for the detailed updated list - really appreciate it! I have a few questions about your changes, just so I better understand why you've switched certain things out:
  1) Is it better to have a CPU with an integrated graphics card then, even if you have a dedicated video card installed too?
  2) The LTT guide recommended setting up memory in dual racks - would the memory here (2 sticks of 32gb) be considered dual rack?
  3) Is the 120mm exhaust fan to replace one of the case exhaust fans, or in addition to it?
  Thanks

 Pretty sure Blender heaviliy favours Nvidia, just don't know what sort of rendering. If you AMD could be a choice you could have same performance for less or better performance at current price. Tried to go a bit premium so you have lower noise levels hopefully. If you're paying this much might as well:

 You might consider an AMD build. I've included the 7800X3D which will offer better gaming performance in the titles mentioned. Performance in work software will be very good, just not as good as an Intel.

You want 2x32GB not 4x16GB so that you don't stress the memory controller. Integrated graphics is always a plus if it fits into your budget (look at the i7 13700). The 120mm fan goes inside the back of that case for a rear exhaust fan. The case comes with 2x140mm font intake fans but no rear exhaust fan.

  So this is my new list, combining suggestions from each of your lists - @brob I have also made an AMD alternative list based off of your advice, but if I opt for 16 core, it took me over budget and so stuck with Intel for now.
  The second SSD is for an offline work backup drive, and from what I understand with this setup, I'll need to flash update the motherboard's BIOS for it to function properly with the CPU. It's safe to say, there'll be a lot of reading the manuals and researching best BIOS configuration practices!
  Again, I'd welcome any thoughts on the new list

  All cores are not equal. The 12 core 7900X, about £15 more than the i7-13700K, has slightly higher performance than the i7.
  You will need to use Windows 11 with Intel CPU for optimal scheduling. It is tailored to take full advance of the CPU's Thread Director to manage core scheduling.
