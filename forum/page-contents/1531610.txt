 Which motherboard would you recommend for running an Intel 13600k?  So far, these have been my personal choices:  - ASUS Prime Z790-A WIFI- Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX- MSI Tomahawk Z790 Wifi  I'm completely in the dark with DDR5 though, no idea what to get, what about these? G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 DIMM CL32-39-39-102  I gravitate towards the Gigabyte though I'm unsure of that GPU lock on the Gigabyte, looks it could conflict with a GPU backplate?

I'd probably go for the Elite, just because the feature set of that board works best for me (I like a ton of USB and the safe boot button is really handy), but the Tomahawk has its reasons to get.

I've used one of the boards with the similar mechanism (B650 Aorus Elite AX), and it didn't conflict whatsoever with the 7900 XTX Red Devil I used. I'd say it's pretty unlikely you'd get in a situation where it would conflict.

If it's the 2x32GB or 2x48GB kit, it might be a bit too hard on your IMC depending on how lucky you are. That kit isn't anything special, I wouldn't go for it over a say a TeamGroup or Kingston kit in the same speed bin if the price is lower, but I wouldn't avoid it either.

In order to have one on Z790, you need to reduce the primary x16 slot down to just x8. That doesn't make a huge difference to performance, but it is measurably worse for no real benefit outside of some storage benchmarks.     On 9/16/2023 at 2:19 AM, Melodist said:What about the Tomahawk? Any advantages over the Elite?Solid board, it's got an extra SATA port and a few extra fan headers at the expense of a few USB ports. In practice they're going to be basically identical and you should more shop based on looks and who's BIOS you prefer (personally I prefer Gigabyte's, but both are definitely usable).     On 9/16/2023 at 2:19 AM, Melodist said:Gainward 3070 Ti, will transition from my 9900K PC.That should fit just fine, from what I can tell from photos that card has a thinner backplate than the Red Devil XTX I used with that same PCIe lever.     On 9/16/2023 at 2:19 AM, Melodist said:What's your current motherboard?Z690 Unify-X. The board I mentioned with the Gigabyte tall PCIe release was the B650 Aorus Elite AX.     On 9/16/2023 at 2:19 AM, Melodist said:Can you explain to me please why it would be hard on the IMC?Sure. The 2x16GB and 2x24GB kits are single rank, while the 2x32GB and 2x48GB kits are dual rank. As a general rule, more ranks is more difficult for the IMC to run at high speeds, and thus the lower capacity kits are capable of higher speeds than the higher capacity kits.     On 9/16/2023 at 2:19 AM, Melodist said:So same timings different brand?Yeah, basically anything in that same speed bin (6400 CL32) will be practically identical. With DDR5 brand really doesn't matter all that much, most everything mildly fast will be using the same exact SK Hynix based memory ICs, the PCB doesn't seem to make a huge difference (the green PCB sticks clock just as well as the ones from G.Skill), and the PMIC with most higher speed kits should be Richtek across the board at this point. If you can save a bit of money by going with someone else, I would.

I'm personally on Z690 with a 13th gen CPU, and I don't really have many complaints about it other than BIOS updates for things like 2x24GB support being a bit slower than the Z790 boards.   For the most part though, the price of the Z790 board is the same/within $10 of the Z690 board, and at that point you might as well just get the Z790 board as for the most part it will be a little better.

Generally the main difference is the 6400 kits are a little harder on the memory controller, and with dual rank memory the bad CPUs will run into issues. Generally though if they're both CL30/32, they're going to be the exact same memory kit and you can set the clock speed and timings of one to the clock speed and timings of the other, so just getting whatever is cheapest isn't a bad idea.

In terms of reliability, future-proof-factor for 14th Gen but also performance?  It seems that 6400 is very stressful for the controller? I want my new computer to last for some years and not swap it out let's say in 3 and more like 5 or more? The most I'd probably do is maybe upgrade the CPU but that's it.  I'd say for example during DDR4, for me, the sweetspot was actually PC3200 at CL14 running B-Die in 4 channels flawlessly. That's been running for 5 years for me without a single flaw, stably and fast as hell.

The numbers I've given (6400 for single rank configs, 6000 for dual rank) are based on if you lost the silicon lottery what I'd expect to just work, not the average chip or even a golden sample.

That's been running for 5 years for me without a single flaw, stably and fast as hell.It depends what platform you're talking about. If you're on Ryzen 1000 or Haswell-E, 3200 CL14 was sketchy at best. If you're on 11th gen or Ryzen 5000 especially, I'd rather have a 3600 CL16 kit, or even faster. Right now we're in a similar place to where Haswell-E was with DDR4, where the speeds that will be considered relatively pedestrian in 3-5 years are hit or miss today.   If you want comparisons to B die, that would be Hynix 16Gb A die currently. It clocks to the moon (similar to good B die), does very tight subtimings (similar to B die, a lot of the time better), and is generally the first thing that motherboard makers optimize for. The only differences are the tRCD doesn't go tight (B die was an anomaly in that regard) and it's actually consistent (B die was infamous for being all over the place, where I've had kits that do 4800 CL15 and kits that won't even do 3200 CL16), so honestly I'd say it's better. The consistency with it means that even if you buy a 6000 CL30* or 6400 CL32 kit, you can just dial in the settings of higher rated A die kits and expect it to just work. When memory controllers get better, for instance, you should easily be able to enter DDR5 8000 CL38 with one of those kits and expect it to just work.   The 24Gb M die is the bigger brother to A die, it's basically the same thing but higher capacity and slightly looser timings. Supposedly it should clock higher, but with my experience it doesn't (granted, this might be BIOS and/or board issues). I'd reasonably expect it to just work with a 7200 CL34 speed bin though if you just dial it in.     The 14th gen memory controller is supposedly significantly better than the 13th gen memory controller, to the point where it's actually guaranteed to hit DDR5 6400 (allegedly, well find out for sure Tuesday IIRC). It will support faster, and it might be that 7200 becomes the speed that "just works" on 14th gen, but at the same time those 6400 rated kits will support that speed anyway so you might as well just use them, they aren't slow by any means anyway.   *6000 CL30 is only 50/50 to be A die, the older Hynix 16Gb M die is also present on these sticks and while it does perform really well with even tighter timings a lot of the time, it clocks no where near as high as A die does.

The numbers I've given (6400 for single rank configs, 6000 for dual rank) are based on if you lost the silicon lottery what I'd expect to just work, not the average chip or even a golden sample.   It depends what platform you're talking about. If you're on Ryzen 1000 or Haswell-E, 3200 CL14 was sketchy at best. If you're on 11th gen or Ryzen 5000 especially, I'd rather have a 3600 CL16 kit, or even faster. Right now we're in a similar place to where Haswell-E was with DDR4, where the speeds that will be considered relatively pedestrian in 3-5 years are hit or miss today.

One really doesn't have a benefit over the other. I'd probably go for the Corsair kit, just because G.Skill's RGB and overall inadequate heatsinks does cause memory temps to be rather high, but then again I'm a memory overclocker and that type of criticism is only really relevant for people like me, and you may enjoy the aesthetic benefits of the RGB.     2 hours ago, Melodist said:Still not sure whether I should pick 850 or 1000 Watts.Odds are you don't need more than an 850W, though I'd get a 1000W if the price difference isn't massive.

Right now I'm running an EVGA Supernova 1300 G2, because at the time I bought it, it was the cheapest 1000W+ unit with great reviews (I bought it used, hence why I got it for so cheap). Right now, in the US (where I'm from), that unit would be the Phanteks Amp v2 100W.

Expand  I used to do it the exact same way you do and I guess forgot , maybe for a bit nervous with all the new specs and different way of how nowadays' CPUs pull power compared to Intel Gen 9. I think our PSUs should be almost the same age, I picked the EVGA G2 with 850 watts but it's going to be 7 1/2 to 8 years old and needs to be replaced.  So you're saying the Trident Zs aren't really good this time around? The were superb when I got them at PC3200 Spec CL14.   Any other brand and series you'd recommend besides the Vengeance for the 6400 kit at CL32?

 COMMENT_BREAK   1 hour ago, Melodist said:So you're saying the Trident Zs aren't really good this time around?My relationship with G.Skill on DDR5 is complicated. Their PCB is rather good, and from what I've seen they consistently do tighter timings than their green PCB counterparts and other brands, but it's only 1-2 of the subtimings that are consistently better so not really that big a deal. Their heat spreaders themselves isn't actually that bad, but the problem with them is they didn't put a thermal pad between the PMIC (the main heat generator on the sticks) and the heat spreaders, so memory temps end up being rather high.   I don't avoid their kits, if they were a good price I'd be buying (hence why I currently own two different G.Skill DDR5 kits), it's just that I either limit the voltage I run into them for long periods (my 24GB sticks I don't run above 1.4V and my 16GB sticks I don't generally run above 1.5V with active airflow as they end up with voltage rollover) or just remove the heat spreaders and run them bare as my Flare X5 6000 CL30 kit currently is (this kit I got used so the warranty was non-existent, hence why I felt comfortable doing this). With the same amount of cooling bare the Flare X5 kit can handle 1.65V without rolling over, and even more for benchmarking itself.   If you aren't overvolting or overclocking your RAM, none of this is really that big an issue, they do stay below dangerous temps and are stable at the XMP, it's just that the memory itself is rather high compared to everyone else and thus if it's the same price as someone else, I'd go for the other brand.     1 hour ago, Melodist said:The were superb when I got them at PC3200 Spec CL14.Their DDR4 was pretty good, yeah. If I wanted a good B die kit and didn't want to deal with the silicon lottery, I'd be buying a higher rated G.Skill kit like 3600 CL14 or 4000 CL16, as their kits generally had the best binning. Surprisingly though the best kit of DDR4 I ever owned was from Adata of all places, in a 3600 CL17 bin (the 2nd worst guaranteed Samsung B die bin). That kit had a terrible, all plastic heat spreader, but it scaled with voltage indefinitely and would run insane settings (the best I ever got was 4800 CL15, and I'm pretty sure it would go higher if I had a better CPU).     1 hour ago, Melodist said:Any other brand and series you'd recommend besides the Vengeance for the 6400 kit at CL32?Everything I've seen has shown that TeamGroup and Kingston have some very good heat spreaders on their DDR5 kits, so if I could take any it would be a TeamGroup kit (especially for the 2x24GB sticks where the memory temps get exceptionally high). Generally though I'd just be getting whoever is the cheapest, there really isn't that much difference between all the different brands. TeamGroup's T-Create brand has been a rather good value, at least in the US.
