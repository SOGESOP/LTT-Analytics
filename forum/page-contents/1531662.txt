Just want to be sure if current pc mobo and other components will support the above upgrades, checked cooler and case dimensions and cooler is supposed to fit but if someone can check the dimensions it would be helpful as I don't have much experience with pc building, also I would have to upgrade mobo bios (there's google to help me with that).

Why not a 5800X3D??? Need a good CPU for 1080 60Hz and might as well get a decent CPU to upgrade to with a $720 budget.

There's almost a difference of $100 or more between 5800X and 5800X3D, it's a bit out of my budget.

 The newer 5700X runs cooler than the older 5800X while giving you similar performance.

Well, that's the part I'm confused about right now. To go with the 5800X or the 5700X, isn't higher number supposed to be better and why was 5700X released after 5800X?
