 Problem: I have a problem with my CPU, it has unusual high temps. Right now it has 73.5C on idle. Which is too hot, I put energy saving mode on through armoury crate but it doesn't do much. I updated the BIOS to the newest settings. When I started it up it went up to 90C.
hope somebody can help me

 Bad cooler mount most likely.

What does this mean? I used the built-in mount, it sits firmly on the CPU

Too little thermal paste, not removing the sticker at the bottom, not tightening the screws enough for better contact etc.

Okay, I am checking the thermal paste. Is this a shitjob?

  Doesn't look bad enough to have caused such bad temps. Make sure you remove the sticker at the bottom of the cooler, and make sure you used correct brackets etc. I don't know that specific cooler & CPU combination but your issue is in the mounting of the cooler. (Unless CPU has a massive hardware issue which is unlikely)

Checked that, I think the screws that I have for my AIO to screw into the backplate are not long enough. Like I can still push down the AIO a little bit.

Check for brackets, retention bars etc. in the box

 Are you sure the cooler block is oriented the correct way per the manual ??
    might  be worth a few minutes to just take everything off look at the install guide one more time and then reinstall everything ... It isn't the end of the world but that looks like too much paste to me in your photo.

The problem is, you canâ€™t unscrew the backplate

Sorry if this is a stupid question, is this correct? I never thought of doing it like that. The picture above confuses me a bit.

So the orientation is right  .. however look at the instructions they have a bit about offset mounting (I don't have this cooler or cpu myself).. but maybe the offset is the problem?
  Take a look here::

  Notice deeper cutout down towards PCIe slot , shallower bracket up top and #2 mounting holes

If this was after the cooler was mounted, there's your problem. The majority of the CPU isn't making contact with the cooler, only some of the left side.
