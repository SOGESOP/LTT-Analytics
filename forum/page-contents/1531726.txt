 First I wanna say being at the point we have to specify "dumb-cars" is ridiculous.
Some regulatory bodies are outlawing cars based on emissions or age. You can still use a reasonably dumb-car today and probably 10 years into the future. But in the 30's, 40's, and onward, what will we do? The only way forward I see is building custom cars.
  In the case of emissions, individuals could take old cars and convert them to electric drive. Or if age or safety is an issue, just take a newer car and rip out all the smarts. But that would most likely cripple the car. So the custom builder would need to replace all the major components with custom components. A new market could sprout from this. Maybe even small companies starting up to create product lines of dumb-cars. Or at least FOSS and privacy respecting cars.
  I drive an 02 Ford Ranger and am lucky enough to live in a location without mandated inspections and where emissions laws are grandfathered from the year of manufacture. I refuse to own a smart-car ever.

 What car?
  I get the idea. You don't drive a car anymore, you get into a large mobile tracking device that mimics a car.
Emissions is just a catchy term corporations and goverments use to trick people into believing spending a shitload of money in "car, but with batteries" will "save the planet", yeah, sure. The average joe is so overwhelmed by the oppresive labour system that has no time to think adding more cars to the equation won't actually fix anything, just like adding one more lane to a highway that's already 10 lanes wide won't fix traffic.
I mean, I'm an utter retard and even I know the actual solution to pollution is STOP MANUFACTURING SHIT, like, that's it, stop planned obsolescence trash that dies after 18 months, stop moronic nonsense fads, stop bombing the ground to get minerals for batteries that will go into stupid little terribly inefficient 2 ton cars used to move 60kg people around concrete jungles, stop the money printer that pays debt out of thin air.
BUT NO, THAT'S COMMUNISM HOW DARE YOU SAY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS BETTER!!!! I get what the problem is, the delusion is so big now that if you actually put an end to shitty products and lack of urban planning you'd have millions of unemployed people, so yes, that's the issue.
  Don't ask me how to fix it tho.

Beautiful. 80s and 90s Fords had such style.

 Yeah, it's a shame when you can't even go for drive without your car spying on you and selling your routines and whereabouts to the highest bidder.

I usually get to like 20-25 years before I replace the car. There's plenty of 30-40 year old cars cruising around here in Aus, most you could daily without much trouble, I can still buy a 'dumb' car today and with current build quality you should be able to get 30 years out of the damn thing. 
  Now when they tell me I can't drive my 77 year old tractor on the road, then I'm fucked...but that's another story.

 At least in the US, I don’t anticipate that continued grandfathering in of old vehicles won’t be done. In California (generally one of the more restrictive states), you can legally drive without seat belts, if your vehicle did not originally come with them (I believe anything before 1964). 
  Motorcycles are a thing that exists as well. Though motorcycling would probably be significantly safer if the worst-performing 10% of drivers were replaced by self-driving cars.
