 I used to use Dimly, but i feel that it being an overlay filter isnt good and if there was a way to just turn on the auto brightness at say 2 am, and turn it off say at 6 am, automatically without me needing to do it...
  i dont like keeping auto brightness all the time. dont like the constant brightness change.
