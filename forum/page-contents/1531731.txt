 Directly from Microsoft. Can't discuss any other method on the forum because of the forum rules.
  Well, one other method. If you own (or acquire) a Windows 7 PC with a valid key, that key can be used to activate Windows 10 (and 11?).

If you want fully legit? Best Buy, Staples, or direct from Microsoft.com.

 Fully legit would be a retail key from a major outlet or Microsoft directly, you could also buy physical copies of windows media with full retail keys as well.
  Otherwise, any source of OEM windows key is the same. That’s what most people do for a cheap windows key is just buy an OEM key from whoever, there’s many sites that sell them including major platforms like Newegg/Amazon/etc
Except those sites are using brand recognition to look like it’s a more legitimate product than it actually is. Any source of oem key is the same remind you, the $100 key on Newegg is the same validity of a $15 key anywhere else.

 buy one from microsoft, or buy a boxed copy from the many parts retailers.
  if you dont buy it trough official channels, all you're doing is funnel some money into a shady hole to make yourself not feel like a pirate, because someone else broke the EULA for you.

 To add on, I'll avoid eBay and even Amazon. The latter is because you could end up with a third-party seller which could easily be those illicit keys if one isn't careful.

  Was surprised that this worked. I tried this two months ago, because I had nothing to lose. Bought a new system last autumn and a new OS was not in the budget. Luckily you can run free Win 10 with a watermark. Did this for 6 months and the watermark did get annoying at times..
    My 10 year old Win 7 system, was only going to be used if I wanted to watch my cd/DVD shows/film collection.
  That Win 7 key is a OEM key from 10 years ago. Only sold with computers built by that store. That company went bankrupt in 2017? I think.
It worked instantly, no issues and no more annoyances. So good on MS for that.
      My system can not run Win 11, so no idea if that is a possibility.
