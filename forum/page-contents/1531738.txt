 Hi all, currently pulling my hair out over this weird issue so decided I’d dust my account off and ask for help. So I have upgraded my pc to a new motherboard and cpu (ASUS B660-P D4, i5 12400F) and after doing so I could no longer boot into windows and would get the error regarding boot device inaccessible or something of that nature. When going into the bios I could only see my other SSD and not the one windows is actually installed on listed as a boot option (all my drives are showing up correctly in the bios but only one as a boot option) so I went through the usual route of changing all the boot settings in the bios for uefi to legacy, updating the bios, trying every possible setting all to no avail. Thankfully the SSD it would see didn’t have anything super important on it so I decided to use another PC I have in the house to format the drive and create a windows install USB to try and install windows onto the fresh drive. However after doing this my pc is still trying to boot from this SSD and in the windows install USB the drive doesn’t even exist nor do any of my other drives. If anyone could potentially tell me why this may be and what I have to do to fix it it would be greatly appreciated! Can’t imagine 3 drives have all failed at once and really hoping my brand new motherboard isn’t bad!!
