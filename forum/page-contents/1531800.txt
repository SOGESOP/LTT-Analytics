 Linus put up a survey on how many people could tell the difference between their videos before the hiatus and after the hiatus. (Related to GN's discovery on LMG.) Unsurprisingly, not many people could tell the difference. I bring this up because of Linus's decision to put up the survey and his attitude around it. I think LMG is still untrustworthy, especially after the whole conundrum with GN. Him putting up this survey and saying how we don't know a lot about what's going on is disconcerting. What's disconcerting about this isn't the fact that he is right, it's the fact that's a given. Since that's with all, if not most, large corporations. Regardless of how transparent they are. There will always be something about the internal workings we don't know. Therefore, the need to put up that survey is not necessary. It's led me to believe Linus only put up that survey to see if he could pull the same stunt again. Specifically, so he could be more subtle with the stunt so he could get away better with it.
  What enforces these conclusions is how he talked about the employee videos. The ones where LMG employees talked about working at LMG. He said they were weaponized against him. While this was the case, the response to stop making them; Tells me he isn't confident that he could fix the mistake he made. I draw this conclusion because he should be able to continue to make those kinds of videos. Especially if he's actually learned from the mistake he made. But, the fact that he has said there will be no more. Tells me that he might've not learned from the mistake he made. Therefore, it's highly probable he will pull the same stunt again in the future. He'll just be more subtle about it.

Maybe it's good we don't know. They may be protecting us from something (I doubt it but maybe)

What they said in their 'plan' video is that they aren't gonna change the videos. They're gonna change how they deal with things internally. Doesn't mean it has to be different on the surface. I liked how they did videos before it anyways. The timeline of their 'Here's the plan' vid kinda sums up how they're not gonna change anything that we're gonna notice in the videos that much. But they're changing and most likely changed how they're doing things internally and how they deal with it

Possibly, but just because his names on the company doesn't mean he was single-handedly in charge of all the wrong doings

 Many of the changes will be so minuscule we wouldn't notice anyway.
It's mostly fact checking and a few other things BEFORE posting videos. Basically what they should've been doing since the get go.

he knows he's right about what the outcome of the poll would be, because he can read comments and see how well videos are performing. despite what it seems like on the surface, linus isnt an idiot.

the purpose of the survey is to have something to base his argument on, that the way they produce videos will essentially stay the same, only the "chain of responsibility" to make sure the video is based in fact is what changes. he could just say "you lot know those were made before the break, right?" but without showing what the actual thoughts of the community at large are, you'd be here complaining about how he has no idea what his community thinks.. while in fact, he clearly does.
  the point isnt that "he's right", the point is that he wanted to use it as an example to show the change in production is much smaller than what is preceived. it's essentially only a tool to show confirmation bias in the community.

again.. yes.. but no. the reason they're gonna stop making them, is because the concept of the videos is that it's a means for the employees to publicly speak their own mind about working at LMG.. but if those employee's words are then pulled WAY out of context that's not only a bad look for LMG, it's a bad look for the employee, and most importantly it makes the employee the center of a debate they may not want any stake in to begin with. not making the videos is a way to protect their employees against the drama you lot are making. i dont think it's the right choice, i think it's the only choice they realisticly have.

 I got that stage of the video, paused, came here. Because I knew someone would be complaining about it. And I am glad to see that @Lupusvir has not disappointed. 
  We know that the videos are filmed and released in varying orders and timelines. This came up after the stepping down as CEO video - everyone said he looked happier but it was filmed weeks beforehand. This is not new and he knows people like Lupisvir project onto what they see with no regard to the facts. 

And not doing the staff videos protects them - can Lupus imagine how look felt seeing his facial expressions twisted by Tech Judas? Never mind all the other staff utterly twisted by the fake journo Steve. 

The poll was not a stunt - it was a practical lesson on how "viewers" like Lupusvir get things so wrong. 

But I want to see the videographer staff reaction to their demands for slower production times leading to LTT failing down the algorithm rankings. Sure, they get a few extra hours to do things but less people see the prettier pictures.

the algorithm is a weird beast, it's most likely the change in consistency that's had the biggest impact, as opposed to the change in pace, if that makes sense.
