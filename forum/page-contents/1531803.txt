- I'm probably forgetting a bunch, but in general: coding, compiling, photo and video editing, streaming, a couple VM's and browsing + occasianal gaming.
  Current hardware: Build from 2016
- Asus Maximus VIII Hero DDR4 socket 1151 Z170
- Intel I7 6700K OC 4.5GHz
- Asus-Strix-GTX970

  peripherals:
- webcam usb-a
- mic blue yeti usb-a - want to upgrade in the future to a xlr mic
- keyboard k70 2x usb-a
- logi mx master 3
- bluetooth dongle usb-a 2x
- speakers old logitich 5.1 so need those jacks (green, black, orange)
- 2x benq 27inch 1440p one connected with hdmi, the other mini-displayport.
- 1x Dell 23inch 1080p (vertical stand) DVI-D - i figure this will be a problem
  future upgrades in peripherals: XLR mic, new monitor probably 34inch 4K (and removing the Dell), probably new speakers at some point. Use current setup to transform to server.
But for now no need in upgrading peripherals.
  When to buy:
As soon as possible, unless it's beneficial to wait a little longer. I have done some research and some say November is ideal, others say September is good because they come out with new hardware at the end of the year.
Honestly I try to follow and read up to a lot of hardware stuff, amd, intel, nvidea, readon. But I'm a software guy, I can build my own desktop and there is the end of my knowledge.
To each their own specialty. Please only begin suggesting something if you enjoy doing this kind of thing. I don't need someone telling me: "Hey at least put a list in pcpartpicker." I'll explain why I haven't.
  Problem:
I'm not sure if I should go with amd5 or intel, why?
1. I need to use windows for development reasons
2. I need and want to use linux - nvidea is not good at supporting drivers, so Radeon sounds better.
3. I'm going into data/AI development and the CUDA cores in Nvidea are good for that.
4. I can use cloud services for large datasets - so I may not need those cuda cores after all.
5. I don't care for ray tracing or ultimate settings for gaming, and most of the games i play are resource-management focused and probably more CPU heavy.
6. Although I do a lot of photo and video editing and I don't know if nvidea vs radeon has a big part in those workloads.

What's important:
1. my I/O needs to be fast
2. I need enough cores for my VM's I figure 16 cores?
3. I need a decent amount of RAM 32GB, maybe 64GB?
4. my main drive should at least be 1TB since programming stuff takes a lot of space. and another 2TB drive would be nice. Since my current ones aren't M2.
5. I don't think I'll be OC like i did previously - but a BIOS flash button is handy - as is an indicator on Motherboard for faults.
6. enough USB-A and USB-C
7. integrated Bluetooth would be nice (but optional since I use dongle now anyways)
8. audio jacks
9. no RGB, again I don't need RGB.
10. Silent, cool temps.

Question 1 :
I have a retail version of windows, if i do a complete overhaul will they accept my retail version or are they gonna expect me to buy a new license for this new build?
I guess they will, the ******. Since the current setup and case will be used for server (linux).
  Question 2 :
What about cooling? I have my desktop in the attic, summers can get very hot. I have been looking up water vs air cooling a lot, but it keeps unclear to me.
I get that the water has some kind of buffer and then it will probably be mostly the same..
I prefer a lot of fans at a lower speed to keep things cool. My current water cooling makes a lot of noise.
Are those noctua really that good or is it hyped by influencers?


Thanks if you got till the end, I am aware this is a load of talk and I feel like i missed some things still.
I prefer to spent a good amount on SSD, RAM and Motherboard, I guess for my use on video editing the GPU will be important but I'm not gonna pay 1000 euro for a graphics card.
  Please ask for additional information, if needed.

you can reuse it. No need to buy a new one

they're good but overpriced. I'd rather get the phanteks T30s

We can get a baller build for 3000 euro budget
We can have intel or amd (tho intel will be hotter and harder to cool)
If you don't want/need the 4090 for your application then just tell me

 Thanks for the work invested in making both lists!
I don't feel good with spending half budget on a graphics card.
  And this is the problem I'm not sure if it will make a big difference in my editing work.
For my datasets - I don't worry too much since there are cloud services for that.

The case comes with 2 fans, the liquid cooler has 3 and the power supply also has a fan,  I guess that will be sufficient or should i invest in more fans?
I'm still looking at the differences in motherboards and memory.
Also need to look up performance between the CPU's you mentioned.

-- If someone has answers to my other questions that would be nice. Thanks in advance
