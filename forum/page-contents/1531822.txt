 Hey guys,
My current system:
Amd ryzen 7 3700x
MB Asrock AB350 pro 4
Ram 16 GB DDR4
Gigabyte RTX 2070
SSd 128gb
SSd 256 gb
HDD 1TB
  I was considering updating my MB, which chipset should i go for, keep in mind that i am on a budget.
Can you guys give some recomendations ?
Thanks in advance

 What are you hoping to achieve by changing motherboards? It's not going to make any difference in performance if all the other parts are the same.
  If you're not changing CPU's, then you're restricted to other AM4 chipsets.

not excpeting performance gains, just to extend the life of my system.

  Does the person who wants to buy it know that you think it's causing blue screens?

 There are lots of decently priced B550 boards to choose from, which features do you need, or would like?
  2x M.2 slot and 1x SATA is pretty easy to find, for example (full-size ATX): Gigabyte B550 Gaming X V2 is around $120.
  The next level up would be e.g. the Gigabyte Aorus Elite, MSI Tomahawk and Asus Strix B550-F, but do you need stuff like higher-end audio, SPDIF, RGB, rear USB Type-C?
  There are sometimes deals on X570 boards too, but stock seems pretty low now.
