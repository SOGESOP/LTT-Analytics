 I've noticed you're using air compressors to clean the computers and parts which is great.  I run a small computer repair shop of my own which has it's own issues but what's the best way to silence the air compressor?  I know videos get done on most everything, how about a video about Silence of the Compressor.  Anyhow I wanted to know what was done to reduce the noise level.  Was it distance, a special type of unit, a sound proof room or something else?
  Thanks!

 They probably just have enough hose to get far away from it, or it has a large enough tank to get the job done with the pump switched off.
  I have a 2-gallon "Fortress" ultra-quiet compressor from Harbor Freight. It's not exactly silent, but it's not so loud that it's intolerable to have running in a relatively small room. They have larger versions they rate to about the same decibel level.

 Hello,
  I have a craftsman one, in a sound proofed room inside a room that is 800 sqft and within 30 feet it's still too loud. 

Mine looks like this https://www.mowersatjacks.com/product-details/proforce/vlf1582019?gclid=cj0kcqjwx5qobhdyarisapbmagca4ckeeugfcmnejxcu69ach9gjxggacfemenrhc8ll-11jwobryygaaocrealw_wcb
  Unfortunately so loud you can't be in the same room with it even when it's contained in a sound dampened room off to the side, so I don't know what to do without spending close to $10k+ on one.
  Thanks
