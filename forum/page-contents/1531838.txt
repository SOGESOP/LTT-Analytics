 I've noticed you're using air compressors to clean the computers and parts which is great.  I run a small computer repair shop of my own which has it's own issues but what's the best way to silence the air compressor?  I know videos get done on most everything, how about a video about Silence of the Compressor.  Anyhow I wanted to know what was done to reduce the noise level.  Was it distance, a special type of unit, a sound proof room or something else?
  Thanks!

 They probably just have enough hose to get far away from it, or it has a large enough tank to get the job done with the pump switched off.
  I have a 2-gallon "Fortress" ultra-quiet compressor from Harbor Freight. It's not exactly silent, but it's not so loud that it's intolerable to have running in a relatively small room. They have larger versions they rate to about the same decibel level.

 Hello,
  I have a craftsman one, in a sound proofed room inside a room that is 800 sqft and within 30 feet it's still too loud. 

Mine looks like this https://www.mowersatjacks.com/product-details/proforce/vlf1582019?gclid=cj0kcqjwx5qobhdyarisapbmagca4ckeeugfcmnejxcu69ach9gjxggacfemenrhc8ll-11jwobryygaaocrealw_wcb
  Unfortunately so loud you can't be in the same room with it even when it's contained in a sound dampened room off to the side, so I don't know what to do without spending close to $10k+ on one.  It's basically in a closet that has sound proofing.
  Thanks

There’sa 26 gallon “ultra quiet” Fortress model for around $400:

  If 4.5 SCFM at 90 PSI is enough for you, it might be an option. I don’t have any hands-on experience with it, and I don’t make a living with air tools, but I’ve been happy with the little one.

 Hello,
  Basically 50dBA or more is too loud however ultra quiet compressors are about 69dBA as I recall and those are still too loud.  I've looked at all the Ultra Quiet compressors and less than 50dBA is hard to get, or extremely expensive.  I wondered if the LTT one is far away with a really long hose or if the noise is removed from the videos vs a really long hose.  Anyhow any other suggestions would be nice.

From what I've seen, they only use it outside where the noise doesn't bother others and as you rarely if ever hear it, its used in so small bursts they can wait until the tank is full. 
  Adam Savage (Tested) has his in opposite corner from where he sits and in sound proofed box (video with timestamps https://youtu.be/25eZ17IoRK4?si=zjguTFzHESge-OBD&t=491). So no easy solutions. Other than doing short bursts and sound proofing as much as you can.

 Ours has an auto-purge that is super loud. To quiet it down we took the 3D model of a gun suppressor, scaled it up so it would fit on the exhaust and 3D printed it. After being stuffed with polyfill it is actually quite effective lol
  That said tho it would be awful to have in the same room and trying to put it somewhere else should be your first step.
