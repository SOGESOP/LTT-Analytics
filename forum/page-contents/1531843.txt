 So I've just finished moving my pc into the new case I got along side some new upgrades.
  I go to put the front back on and the Corsair h100 doesn't fit ...
  So I'm basically stuck with no dust filter/front cover on the front of the pc.
  I bought the Fractal Design Torrent Compact, I am needing a cooler for the 5800x that will clear my RAM, which is Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB.
  I'm a bit out of the loop so not sure what's out there and what's good and what will fit.
  Can anyone help at all please?

That case is built for great air cooling, try a Deepcool AK500 for example, or the new Assassin IV.
