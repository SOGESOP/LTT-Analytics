 I am currently looking for a monitor with 27 inch or larger screen size. It has been a while since I shopped for a monitor and it seems like this segment has gotten pretty competitive.
My budget is ~$400. I have been looking at LG 27GP850, MSI Optix G274QRFW, and various offerings from Asus and Gigabyte (e.g., ROG Strix XG27AQ, ROG Swift PG329Q, GIGABYTE M27Q-PRO, etc.) and they all look pretty good.

 32" 1440p has a pixel size similar to 24" 1080p. So, if you're used to that pixel size and viewing distance, I'd recommend a 32".
With a 27" 1440p you'd have to view it from a closer distance to get the same text size.
