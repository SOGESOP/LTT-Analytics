 Budget (including currency): â‚¹200,000 (INR)Country: IndiaGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for: Blender, Unreal Engine 5, DaVinci Resolve. 3D Modeling/Rendering, Video Editing and maybe some light to moderate GamingOther details (existing parts lists, whether any peripherals are needed, what you're upgrading from, when you're going to buy, what resolution and refresh rate you want to play at, etc):2 Parts Lists that I crudely put together are attached.Looking for a good Mouse and 1440p Monitor.Looking to buy ASAP.1440p60 will be more than enough for me. 

 COMMENT_BREAK Dude, there's no real choice. If you have money, go for 13700K + 4070.

Unless you go for really big scenes in Blender that can eat all of 16 GB of VRAM. In every other workload 4070 is way better.

BTW, Thank you so much for helping thus far.

Anything to second guess and/or change out?If 13600K isn't that much more expensive, I'd suggest getting it instead of KF. If your GPU dies, you'll be glad that you got an iGPU for diagnostic purposes and continuing to do basic tasks. And get an SSD with DRAM cache, they are generally a bit faster and more reliable.
