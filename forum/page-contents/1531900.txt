 Okay, the PC I have has a 1060 in it. The display started cutting out. so I did the standard trying different cables. That didn't help. So I put my pare 750ti into the pc. Same issue. I then realized it was the monitor. So I replaced the monitor with a spare from another PC. It worked. But had red dots all over. I thought it could be a Vram issue. But I was going to try DDU before I did anything rash. I completed the uninstall. Red dots remained, even in Windows safe mode. I then made the awful choice to try another hdmi cord mid install. Which caused a black screen. I then made the even more idiotic choice to force the pc off mid-install. Now It has no display. No Bios display at all. I have tried both HDMI cords. So, What do I even do? Is the 1060 dead? should i put my 750ti back in?

The PC shouldn't need the Nvidia drivers just to get a video output from the GPU. It should be able to fall back on generic display drivers.

What did the red dots mean?

 COMMENT_BREAK It could be dead but I also think that stopping a driver installation halfway should not be the case of causing it to be dead, correct me if I am wrong anyone, but is it possible that OP could put both gpus in and restart the driver installation on the second one?

After a DDU. The 1060 displays again. Sadly the HDMI port is dying. As alot of movement can cause it to start showing red dots or just cut out the image
