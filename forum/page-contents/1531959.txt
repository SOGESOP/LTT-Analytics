 COMMENT_BREAK There are some "patches" that patch the remote desktop service so that it will run on Windows home edition, but eventually windows update removes it or fixes it.  My advice would be to use AnyDesk ... it's free and works great.

 COMMENT_BREAK thanks everyone, I thought I could actually remotely play a game temporarily but I just gave up the idea
