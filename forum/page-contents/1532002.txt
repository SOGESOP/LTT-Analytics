 Hey guys and gals, I need a new PSU for my computer.  I need one that can power the following -RTX 4090 Strix13th Gen CPUMotherboard of course (Asus Brand)1 hard drive (3tb) (I bought this in 2016)2 SSD's (from 2016)I have two M.2 cards connected to the motherboard as well, dont think that matters though.  The power supply that I am using now is a NZXT HALE90 (link is here)https://www.newegg.com/nzxt-hale90-v2-np-1gm-1200a-1200w/p/N82E16817116022?Item=N82E16817116022&cm_mmc=SNC-Facebook-_-SS-_-facebookdeals-_-NA  If you look at that link closely, you can see a bunch of 'peripheral' plug-in spots. I CANNOT find a PSU with these, which is what my 3TB Hard Drive plugs into, as well as my SSD's.  I question myself with,"Am I missing something?""Can my HDD and SDD use different cables that I am not aware of?""Are there PSU's that don't have 'peripheral' plugs but still are able to connect to my HDD and SDD's?"  Why do I need a new power supply if it's powering everything already? Because it's old, the fan doesn't spin and my PC crashes whenever I play any games that need the power. Something is wrong with it and I just want a new one. Got it in 2016. Please, if you can help, I'd greatly appreciate it! I'd like one that is 1000w-1200w if possible!  Feel free to ask questions, I'll bookmark this page and check back often.

The plugs on the power supply on other modular power supplies might look different because different brands/models use different cables. The specifications list for the power supplies you're looking at will list how many SATA connectors they come with.

 COMMENT_BREAK Enermax Revolution D.F. X 1050 W will be perfectly fine and good enough for your build.If you want higher quality unit with more connectors you can go for be quiet! Straight Power 12 1200 W will be good option. There are plenty others to pick from, but those had good prices right now.
