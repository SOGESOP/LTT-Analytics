 So basically I'm deciding between buying a new 4070 or a used 3090 fe for the same price. What would you choose and why?  Fyi: the 3090 fe has been used for one year mining eth. It's been kept in good condition.

 COMMENT_BREAK If you go by TPU's numbers, the 3090 should be roughly 20% faster than the 4070. That's a rather nice bonus for the same price. Assuming the card has been well treated, as you say, it is quite attractive. The one benefit of going with a 40-series card would be frame gen, if you play games that support it (and support it well).  The 3090 also has double the memory capacity, which should give it an edge when playing at higher texture detail levels.

It's been kept in good condition.GDDR6X memory overheats when rolling ethereum random numbers for a chance to print fake money out of thin air.  It depends on what mining operation were they running:"Smart" miners with NiceHash fine tuned the card to achieve maximum "fake money printing"/W and used a modded firmware. Sometimes it's better than using the card all day for gaming because temperature is constant, without the expansion/contraction cycles that cause fatigue to the BGA balls.Other miners instead use out of the box settings, and/or choke the card in cramped enclosure, maybe hiding it in a closet somewhere to steal energy and achieve maximum fake money/energy cost. You don't know how long those cards will last, maybe they'll last until you replace them naturally, other times they start artefacting when a PCB track becomes faulty.LTT has a video where they talk about the issue. in short it might not be a problem:Try itGet customer protection like from e-bayMaybe repaste itUPDATE: I would check the BIOS/firmware if you buy the used 3090. Mining specific firmware and tuning would be bad for playing games.

 COMMENT_BREAK I don't really care that much about frame gen tbh. If the 3090 has 20% performance boost over the 4070 as you say, I'll definitely go with it.Also the double memory capacity definitely is a huge a plus. Thanks for the info!   Edit: this was a reply to Eigenvektor. 

 COMMENT_BREAK I own a 3090 and let me say if it wasnt mined on AND you were prepared to mod the rear vram to cool them and as long as it isnt a Gigabyte card then the 3090 would be the better choice probably. The rear vram on these cards gets cooked from the everything on the front side and you have to mod them or they dont do well or last too long. The 3090 is a hell of a card and it does 4k no sweat, but im not sure id risk buying a used one unless i knew the person well and how it was treated.

 COMMENT_BREAK 4070 if power efficiency is a concern (high power bills)  3090 any day of the week if powerbills are not a concern regardless of mining, besides miners treat cards better than gamers since they undervolt although gddr6x does like to heat up a ton so there is a valid concern here but id personally just ignore that since tjmax is like 105c anyways for gddr6x iirc

 COMMENT_BREAK defo get the 3090 if powe is not a big concern

 COMMENT_BREAK if u can verify it has been kept in good condition and test it i'd get it.24gb VRAM, faster than 4070 too, why not?

 COMMENT_BREAK I'm going to be a hipster and be the RTX 4070 advocate.  12GB of VRAM is sufficient for the foreseeable future for 1440p or less. Unless you plan to jump into 4K gaming, the 4070 or 3090 really isn't enough either way where you'd be jumping a lot higher like to a 7900XTX/4080/4090.  Having a new card that wasn't ran through already not only has an intact warranty but is also less likely to fail prematurely within the next few years. No matter who the card comes from, used parts are always going to be riskier than a new part, if you're concerned about premature failure.  Given Nvidia's gatekeeping on features, getting the RTX 4070 can potentially yield better feature support for future features like DLSS3.X/4.0. This will also likely improve its future resale value or long term usability.  Having solar panels might make the greater power efficiency still pay off over time, just maybe not as much. Less power draw is better regardless if your electricity is cheap or even free.  3090's VRAM issues are no joke, and the FE version isn't that great overall from a serviceability perspective compared to basically any RTX 4070 AIB model.

 COMMENT_BREAK I have the same question but 3090 Ti vs 4070 Ti - leaning towards a 3090 Ti - used - except $200 cheaper than a 4070 Ti here.   I'm also looking at a 7900 XT (same price as the 4070 Ti - all these cards are used).  The good thing about the 4070 series - no mining cards - or at least, probably not.   More efficient power consumption.  I'm a bit concerned about the lack of vram with these cards, though.  Using a 4K TV - the 3090 Ti and 7900 XT are probably better alternatives?   Productivity for me - is the priority - but some gaming, too.   The 7900 XT might not be as good for productivity - but, my research leads me to conclude in video editing - it's good enough - in Davinci Resolve - it's fine.   In Blender - uhhhhhh.... if hip-rt ever gets released as 'officially supported' - it is almost as good as a 4070.  I could live with it if it wasn't more expensive than the used 3090 Ti - which would be the cheapest card.Here are the prices in my country:3090 Ti $700 < 4070 Ti $900 = 7900 XT $900* (assuming I could get the seller down a bit - most likely $950)  For the OP, it seems like a 3090 - works - I was looking at 3090s too - there's more used ones for sale in my locale than the 3090 Ti - but, around the same price - the 3090 Ti I found is a rare 'deal' - and I haven't inquired so maybe it's sold - dunno.   The 3090 gets hot though - and I don't really want to do repasting jobs - a water block is an extra expense.    I'd probably wait til a 3090 Ti shows up - 450w vs 370w (or so), right?  I'd be looking into undervolting, that's for sure.  

 COMMENT_BREAK @Paul17 3090ti,3080ti,and the 3080 are a different story than the 3090. None of those have rear mounted ram chips like the 3090, even though the 3090ti has 24gb of vram and thats because they learned there lesson and just went with the larger vram slabs so everything is on the front side of the pcb. The 3090 isnt a bad card at all, but it needs to be put in the hands of a capable and willing owner with a little bit of experience and know how for tinkering with electronics or they will have nothing but headaches.IIf you plan on doing 4k anytime soon with it, it seems most things are going that way, and you can get it for that much cheaper than the 4070ti, then yeah, id probably get it too. 24GB's of vram is a ton of vram and can keep you going for years till something uses that much up properly. We could build buggy, mem leaking, crap games or mods now and suckup all that vram in frame buffers if we wanted to today, but you'd have to deliberately aim to do that to keep it from crashing like crazy. Stay away from the Gigabyte cracking pcbs also, the 3xxx series are especially impacted with it. The 3090ti's are def much rarer cause they were pretty much a after thought to one up AMD, so most people didnt get them unless they were waiting for a ti to drop or bought a much lower card to tide them over.

 COMMENT_BREAK I would have concerns with the 3090 as a mining card, that they didn't run it with the vram chips overheating. This was a big problem on specifically 3090's due to them having rear mounted chips as well.  Aside from that, it's the superior performer over the 4070 which at best matches a 3080. Where the 4070 wins over the 3090 and even the 3080 is the power usage is much lower, but honestly its still way overpriced given the specs. 

 COMMENT_BREAK How much do you value frame gen and better energy efficiency?
