 So I tried to buy some music from Rob Dougan's website. But the download links are broken (File not found) and the contact form fails (There was an error trying to send your message.  Please try again later.)I've already gotten my money back from Visa, but I would rather get the music.  With no phone number, address, nor other email listed on the site, how can I get in contact with someone to tell them it is broken?  I tried a bit of googling, but I can't seem to find any actual information that is helpful.  https://store.robdougan.com

 COMMENT_BREAK Have you tried contacting the record labels he's signed (or been signed) to?

 COMMENT_BREAK If he's got Twitter you can probably try that.
