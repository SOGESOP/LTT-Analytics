 Ok guys, so i wanna move to "32 1440p monitor. The positive thing in my situation is that i start from the atrociously terrible Asus TUF VG27AQ, so there is basically no other way but up. The only positive thing in that abomination is the height adjustment, but i can easily go w/o it. Initially i stopped at LG's 32GP750, but then i started looking at my local dealers here in Bulgaria and that thing is OVER $650 here, where is should be around the $350, €400 tops. So that's out. The GP850 is above $700 and so i was left at looking for another brand basically. I want 144/165Hz with 10bit color, DP and don't care if it has G-sync or FreeSync license. Found that AsRock have a monitor - the ASRock PG32QF2B, but i couldn't find any review on it. It's at exactly €350 and so naturally it picked my curiosity. Are there any other options however? Have LG completely dominated the budget and mid tier 32" 1440p panels? Samsung are in a price league of their own, Dell are not really present here, Gigabyte have offers, but nothing that catches the eye and also feel overpriced next to the LGs, so is there anything i can choose to replace that terrible Asus?

 COMMENT_BREAK you'd save alot of money and have a better monitor and image quality just by going 27inch, if you have to stick with 32inch, there aren't many choices.
