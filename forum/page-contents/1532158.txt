 Budget (including currency): 0 USDCountry: USAGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for:  MS Edge, Google Docs, Minecraft, Stardew Valley.Other details I have both CPUs lying around already don't need to buy one I'm most likely going to give my little sister a PC upgrade this Christmas in a few months (her pc is really shit like a-4 3400 with a GT 1030 level shit) I'm just going to build it out of old hand me down parts from my old PCs that I already have but I can't decide witch CPU to use A AMD a6 3600 or a Pentium G2020 https://cpu-benchmark.org/cpu/intel-pentium-g2020/https://cpu-benchmark.org/cpu/amd-a6-3600/In geekbench 3 The G2020 gets way better single core performance at 2086 points vs the A6 3600's 1242 but in multicore performance the A6 wins running at 4293 points vs the G2020's 3976. It seems like a tradeoff the G2020 has way better single core and the 3600 has slightly better multicore and idk witch is better so if any of you could help it would be much appreciated 

 COMMENT_BREAK As someone who loves to fuck with the first generation of APUs (I have an A8 3850 in a secondary PC right now), as well as a fair bit of fuckery with slower Intel CPUs (my old laptop has an i5 580M), I would pick the Pentium all day long. While the A6 has more cores, the architecture it uses frankly sucks ass and feels way slower than you think it would, especially under Windows. The best way to describe it is it's like you're gaming with spontaneous lag, it goes along great until it just randomly decides that it doesn't want to do it anymore. My A8 3850, Phenom II X4 810, and Phenom II X6 1055T all exhibit the same issue, it's just how AMD processors of that general era are.  As far as gaming goes, my A8 3850 struggles comically hard with Minecraft, even though both the iGPU and the dGPU I use with it (an HD5750) are both decent enough to run it. The poor CPU is pretty much always at 100%, even if you're not loading/generating a chunk. I think that might be another case where the Pentium is the way to go.

Here is a great analogy from a reddit thread: You have a highway. Highways have a speed limit and highways have lanes.On Highway 8350, you have a speed limit of 80, but it's an 8 lane highway.On Highway 3770, you have a speed limit of 140, but it only has 2 lanes.If you only have one fast car, you're better off on Highway 3770. If you have a bunch of trucks, you are better off on Highway 8350, because you can have more trucks going at the same time.Most games want a "higher speed limit" - with only 2 cars on the highway at the same time. A lot of productivity software prefer the opposite: having 8+ trucks on the road at the same time.It's about picking the right tool for the job. Sometimes more and slower is better; sometimes fewer and faster is better.
