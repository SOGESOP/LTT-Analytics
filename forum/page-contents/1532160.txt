 Hi guys,  my hp pavilion is doing a bios update but it got stuck at 39% and hasn’t moved for the past hour. I saw online that the windows + b or v together with the on button should fix it, but nothings is happening. I’m unsure what I should do because I’m pretty sure if I let it run out of battery I will have other issues. Do you guys have any suggestions/ solutions?  thanks in advance!
