Is it the Stream Deck XL you were looking at?

 COMMENT_BREAK No the one to his left with all the knobs.

 COMMENT_BREAK That iMac G4 mod is pretty genius, actually. I like it!

 COMMENT_BREAK Having ASUS sponsor the video is not it. They've barely started to fix their warranty issues and are frequently posted about in the sponsor complaints thread. It's good that they're at least trying to do something now but they haven't shown nearly enough to justify letting them sponsor a video.Pointing people towards a company that's actively screwing over their customers right now just isn't okay to do.

 COMMENT_BREAK Wow Linus looks so much more patient and relaxed in these videos made after the break. Any way, these were all such great setups kinda surprising or not surprising that handheld setups would be common.  I mean a gaming laptop with a discrete GPU built in is the optimal mobile gaming setup.  The obvious question to me is when do we see a handheld that docks into some sort of laptop sized carrier for beffier battery, GPU and maybe storage.  With the screen on it acting like a mouse pad.  Someone's going to try that.  (I know this was filmed before the break.) 

 COMMENT_BREAK This is why ITX builds can be so cool, they're so portable and better than laptops.

 COMMENT_BREAK This dude did not try hard enough with his dell dimension 2400 sleeper

 COMMENT_BREAK I wish I can make the next episode 

 COMMENT_BREAK BTW that PCI card is a RME card, RME makes high end audio interface.Old ones like that one are still worth more than you would believe.

 COMMENT_BREAK   20 hours ago, Helpful Tech Witch said:Expand  For what it is, I really can't hate it. My mods didn't look that good on the inside, but I was(and still am) proud of them.  That first mods are crucial to gain the experience to do a better job on your next mods, and I've been wanting to redo my PowerMac G5 mod recently.

 COMMENT_BREAK Little confused why they accepted ASUS as a sponsor? I thought Linus was just roasting them over an open fire for having warranty issues, customer support problems, BIOS shenanigans, among other things just a few months ago? Seems like the absolute last company LTT would want to have as a sponsor, though perhaps they know something I/we don't.
