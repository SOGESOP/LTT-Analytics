Geforce RTX 2080 super. And no, it doesn't seem to be any specific games. The desktop shuts down i think. Hard to know, The monitors just shut off along with the sound. Pc just stays on until i turn it off.

 COMMENT_BREAK Are all drivers (motherboard/CPU and video card) up to date?  Do you ever get blue screens or is it just locking up and going black?  I had that happen with Baulders Gate 3 but after a few patches it stopped. So it sounds like a software issue.  Have you tried running something Aida64 to test the various parts of your PC? It can sometimes help to diagnose if there's an issue.
