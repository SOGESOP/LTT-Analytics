 COMMENT_BREAK How old is the PSU? if its not all that old it shouldnt be an issue?

So if its a 10 year old PSU that youve bought last year new, then it should be fine, but if youve been using it for 10 years, it will have degraded some.  But that PSU model was released March 2011

 COMMENT_BREAK If your PSU is over 10 years old as @TatamiMatt suggests, then what I usually do is 'retire' the PSU to an older PC that is worth less money.  If your PC is a similar age to the PSU, then I'd just keep it, since the new PSU is probably worth more than your parts.  If you're planning to buy a new PC, then sure, buy a new one.

If you have plenty of money then yes, it is sensible to buy a new PSU for a big upgrade, or for a new PC.

The Pure Power 12 M and RM750e (the newer version) have a 12/16 pin, but the Seasonic GX suggested is pre-ATX3.0/PCIE5 and does not.  If I were you, I'd go for 750 rather than 650, just because it has a bit more utility for the future.  There's a review of the 12 M here and I have a similar opinion to the reviewer (I don't like the capacitors), but it's one of the cheaper ATX3.0/PCI5 PSUs, as is the RM750e.

I’m unsure if I should get it since it’s on sale and the rm750e costs 50$ more.

Give me the country and I can look at PCPartPicker myself.  If you're not willing to share that, for whatever reason:- Asus ROG Strix, Seasonic Focus GX, Phanteks AMP - These are very similar, decent Seasonic-based PSUs, but they're pre ATX3.0/PCIE5 so they have no 12/16 pin (though you can buy one).- Corsair RMx is better than RMe, but only the SHIFT or RMe (2023) is ATX 3.0/PCIE5.- Superflower Leadex III are decent PSUs, but again, they're pre ATX3.0/PCIE5.- MSI A850G PCIE5/A1000G PCIE5 reviewed well, but they're usually more expensive than most brands.- Thermaltake GF3 PCIE5 also reviewed well, but again, they're not cheap.- No idea: CM, Silverstone, Chieftec, Deepcool, Fractal, Lian Li, Montach, NZXT, Streacom.
