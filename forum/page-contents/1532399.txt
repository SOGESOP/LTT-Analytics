 Budget (including currency): ~ $1500 USDCountry: United StatesGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for: Primarily gaming, no streaming / rendering.Other details: Upgrading from a GTX 1070 / i5-8400 looking to switch to amd graphics as I am primarily using linux these days and nvidia is a constant pain point. Currently running a  1440p 60hz and a 3440x1440p 90hz but looking to up the monitors to a higher refresh rate 1440p in the future. I don't need anything overkill and looking to primarily hit a good price to performance. I am fine with going over the budget with a hard cap at $1600 but would prefer to go less than the budget, as I said looking primarily for a good deal. Haven't built a computer since 2016 and have been out of the loop for awhile.

This cooler keeps up with the NH-D15 and is a good match for the 13600k.samsung 970 2TB m.2 instead.RM750e PSU, reliable unit that gives a little more room for GPU upgrade down the line. ( I run a 7700x - Overclocked 4080 on a RM750i with max load of 500-520w )You said you'd like to be under budget that is why I did not increase the GPU to a more expensive unit, trying to keep it around 1350-1400 usd.Its just a few minor tweaks and I am sure many others would tweak differently and getting the same perfomance with different brands, one thing I am certain of is that the CPU cooler will be chosen by everyone.https://pcpartpicker.com/list/7trYgB  1500 buckshttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/yjLwz6

Thank you for the help!
