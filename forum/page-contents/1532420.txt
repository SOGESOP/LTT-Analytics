 I have recently built a gaming pc for the first time.   How do I make sure that everything works as it should?   I haven’t been been impressed by the performance and I’ve also had problems with artefacting in games.

Start with some benchmarks you can compare your scores with, like 3D Mark, Unigine, Cinebench.  Download HWMonitor or HWInfo and have it running alongside your games, to check the clocks and temperatures.
