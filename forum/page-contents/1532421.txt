 Last week's LAN show referred me to this video: "What It Takes to Break a RAM with ESD (ft. Linus Tech Tips)" And I recently caught the one with the camera dude walking through LTT HQ...  Does LMG keep an index that we can follow when Linus et al are directly featured in crossovers with other media? We can't rely on The Algorithm to do it (especially since July when YouTube basically gutted recommendations entirely). If not, why not? e.g., I wholly hope Linus will guest feature in Tom Scott's Lateral sometime. While I would catch it because I get those. But Random Channel XYZ that I probably never encountered like ElectroBoom, I'd never have seen. (And clearly in 2 years YT never thought I should...)
