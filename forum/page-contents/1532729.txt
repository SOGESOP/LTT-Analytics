 So im running Mint in a VM inside windows 10.  i have both Ethernet and a wifi adapter to connect to my phone data hotspot.  i want Mint to completely ignore the Ethernet and only connect to the hotspot wifi everytime i boot in Linux  is it possible?

Just turn the Ethernet off? Click the network icon and disable the wired connection.  Does this not work?

 COMMENT_BREAK the configuration of whatever hypervisor software you're using should allow you to configure where the network connection goes.
