 I'm thinking of this build but there are a few things i'm uncertain of.  - Samsung EVO 2tb 980 pro vs 990 pro. Is the extra money worth the performance?- Corsair RM 850E vs 850X. I'm not sure what the difference is, one says 2021, the other 2023. Is later year better?- Is 2x16gb (32gb) DDR5 6400 fast enough?- Motherboard. I don't need something fancy, MSI z790 Pro Gaming looks like it has nice lightening and has functionality such as 5.1 audio jacks which I need.- Lian li 011 dynamic (is this still the nicest looking case with this front and side glass design or is there something better?- CPU cooler + fans. Obviously since i'm going for the 011 dynamic I want a good looking build. The Cooler Master Illusion with Halo fans look very good for the money right? Performance should be fine too I guess, i'm not looking for the most quiet system, as long as the performance isn't bad or anything I dont feel like going for a Corsair fan system. What do you guys think? What should I change?  I'm taking my old RTX2080 with me since I always upgrade GPU and rest of PC seperate every 5 years or so  Thanks

The updated RMx is called the RMx SHIFT, but it moved the modular board to the side which is not compatible with some cases.

If you want ATX3.0/PCIE5 and can't afford the RMx SHIFT (or it is incompatible with your case), MSI A850G, or Thermaltake GF3, then I'd go for the RMe (2023) or be quiet 12 M.

 COMMENT_BREAK If you're not planning on any overclocking a B760 baord will do just fine.
