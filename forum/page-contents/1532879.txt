 I've narrowed the model of EUDIMM I currently want to https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/module/ecc-udimm-ecc-sodimm/m324r6ga3bb0-cwm/ since friends have recommended Samsung (server) memory and this appears to be a good combination of size and speed.  However this part also seems to be very new on the market.  I can't even get a price, which is one factor that may encourage me to settle for more widely available 32 GB 2R DIMMs.  https://www.google.com/search?q=samsung+M324R6GA3BB0-CWM  Only yields hits for Samsung's own site, and their distributor's page seems ill-suited for normal consumers https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/support/contact-info/global-network/americas/ With many of their partners either not obviously offering Samsung products anymore or seemingly offering services for companies that might want Samsung components as part of their supply chain.  Can anyone recommend a reputable site to order 2-sticks of what's probably the hardest to source component of my build so I can get started?  PS: In case anyone was wondering, these are the other currently useful links for EUDIMM DDR5 that I've been holding on to / just refreshed when looking for parts.  https://www.crucial.com/memory/server-ddr5/mtc20c2085s1ec48brhttps://www.kingston.com/en/memory/server-premier?memory=ddr5&moduletype=dimm&dimmtype=unbufferedhttps://www.micron.com/products/dram-modules/udimm/part-catalog (Too hard to navigate, but search engines can reach specific product pages)https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/module/ecc-udimm-ecc-sodimm/https://product.skhynix.com/products/dram/module/udimm.go (Their website was too hard to navigate) 

 COMMENT_BREAK Can I ask why u don’t want standard ram?

 COMMENT_BREAK   21 hours ago, goatedpenguin said:Can I ask why u don’t want standard ram?Can I ask why you would prefer to buy "standard ram"?  It's unrelated to the topic at hand though.  I assume you prefer to buy unreliable memory due to a combination of a small real reduction in cost (ECC does require 10 chips per rank rather than 8 for DDR5) as well as a plethora of hardware already tuned to operate as fast as possible, rather than modules which may have more conservative baked in timings due to their market targets.  No, the 'on die' ECC isn't enough to change my mind.  I'd choose ECC for the same reason I'd focus on ZFS or some other filesystem with mandatory storage validation checks built in.  Statistics catches up and errors propagate.

 COMMENT_BREAK aight buddy I simply asked why not use non-ecc ram is because what was the need to buy ecc ram in the first place so that I could recommend you something better if ecc ram was not required by what your needs were. assuming I want to buy "unreliable memory " is the dumbest thing I have ever heard, why are you assuming that non-ecc RAM is "unreliable" ecc ram does have its uses but for tasks such as gaming, programming and even a small server; ecc ram is useless, unless your telling me that your running a giant server that is running 24/7 and needs to be "reliable" to prevent data loss. Note that if your planning to use ecc ram on a standard motherbaord it will not work.  Anyways since you want ecc ram here is the best imo:  https://www.crucial.com/memory/server-ddr5/mtc20c2085s1ec48ba1r(good value and performance)
