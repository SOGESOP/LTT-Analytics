 COMMENT_BREAK It's a good thought process, expect the AIO is pricey.    Come back at end of year, there will be new products out that can change current product pricing. 

 COMMENT_BREAK No, that is horrible.ASUS has awful customer service, If your parts dont work ASUS will force you to pay them for replacement parts and you'll have to wait months for a new part.Also, AMD has horrible graphics drivers, and FSR is bad compared to NVIDIA's DLSS 3.5  Switch all your ASUS parts for MSI. Switch your graphics card to a NVIDIA 3070 or 4070.  You can keep the AMD CPU, nothing wrong with that.

Switch your graphics card to a NVIDIA 3070 or 4070.  You can keep the AMD CPU, nothing wrong with that.the AMD gpus offer FAR more performance then their Nvidia counterparts at their price points, if we look at stats like tom's hardware or benchmarking channels on YouTube, then you will see that the 3080 gets absolutely destroyed by the 6950xt, which has performance just shy of a 3090ti, to go with a 4070/3070 would be a misuse of statistics to the highest degree. I appreciate the concerns but driver issues are basically non existent at this point with the odd occasion, most recent I've seen of the AMD GPUs are errors running f1 23 or 22 on the newest gpus which I'm not going for. Their maturity here has aged well with the 6950 xt and I shall take advantage of this.thank you still.  SOURCE:

Don't spout blanket statements without anything to back it up.  Running a 6900XT without issue for a year now, so his 6950XT would be similar.  ASUS is fine, why wouldn't their products work in the first place?   If so, return to Amazon, done.  I use the AP201 case and it's a fantastic little thing.  Very happy with it, would buy again.

 COMMENT_BREAK   3 hours ago, randy123 said:The fact that NVIDIA has better DLSS than FSR (which is proven to be bad) and ASUS scams customers Of course DLSS 3.5 is better, in 1 game.

 COMMENT_BREAK   3 hours ago, randy123 said:The fact that NVIDIA has better DLSS than FSR (which is proven to be bad) and ASUS scams customers Slightly but if you have do slow motion and zoom in or stand perfectly still and focus on a spot to see the difference between the two I wouldn't say that's huge difference. I've heard DLSS 3.5 is supposed to be much better but I don't believe it's implemented in many games right now.  As for driver's AMD's drivers have been pretty stable for a while. I've been using Radeon cards for a while and don't recall many if any issues with my 5700xt or my current 7900xtx.  The only area Nvidia really beats AMD outright is in Ray Tracing.
