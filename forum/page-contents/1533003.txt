If the past is any indication, I'm going to be holding on to this build for a long time and upgrade slowly as time goes on. So I'm just looking for someone to do a quick overview and ensure I covered all my bases without any fatal issues before I pull the plug. Also, a hand-choosing the best motherboard would be great. I will take any other general advice on the config aswell!

 COMMENT_BREAK Hi Foley.  The build looks pretty good but I do have a few suggestions.  1) The noctua NH-D15 whilst still up amongst the best air coolers you can buy is around the same performance as a Thermalright Peerless assasin and Deepcool AK620 which both cost considerably less.  2) You really don't want to run 4800MHZ memory with am5 , A 6000MHZ kit off some sort ideally with a low cas latency would be the way to go.  3) Asus B650 boards have notoriously high vrm temps but I don't know if its as bad on the one you are looking at , Definately look into it though because the 7800X3D will not cause issues but who knows what you might want to throw into it in a few years time.  The MSI board is solid though.
