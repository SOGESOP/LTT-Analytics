 Hi everyone, I need some help. So my father is 70 on Friday, we have all the birthday stuff ready to go. 1 problem, he plays total war all the time, and some other RTS like Cossacks,lots of them but all RTS, just with him yesterday and seen how slow his old dell PC is but I know nothing about what to get. I thought I did until I went online to look! What I need is someone to just send me the exact pc to buy, even a link to it, theres so much to look at and I have no idea. The budget is another problem, normally I would just get something expensive and hope it works like his 10 year old dell (was never a good computer for games to begin with), I am in Ireland but willing to buy for I guess anywhere in Europe but my budget is about 6-700 Euro. Refurbished is okay, its not an issue. It doesnt have to even look good (although it would be nice), so if someone who knows there stuff and can tell me, well... firstly is it possible on that budget but if it is maybe a link to the item, no TV no keypad or anything just something I can install Total War Pharaoh and see the expression when it actually works. I even bought three kingdoms last year but never got it working. Anyway people. Thank you for your time and your help is really appreciated!
