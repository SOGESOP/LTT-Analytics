 I had a power outage today and my PC is connected to a UPS, so I woke it up, closed all my programs, and shut my PC down. After it shut down, I turned off my UPS, as I do after every power outage. When the power came back on, I turned my UPS back on. I waited until it was fully on, then I tried to turn on my PC. I pressed the power button on my case and walked away to wait for it to boot. When I came back, my display was black and when I checked the inside of my PC, the GPU fans were spinning, but my CPU and system fan weren't. I followed the same procedure I always do during a power outage, so I suspected that my PSU finally died (I got the PC in spring 2015) and I have had some random crashes and freezes in the past year. I ordered a new one, but I am experiencing the same issue.
  Specs:
CPU: i7-4790
CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D9L
GPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC BLACK GAMING
Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-Z97X-SLI (I'm not sure what my BIOS is, but I know it is before version F8 based on when I bought it)
RAM: 2x4 Adata 1600 mhz DDR3 kit and 2x4 Patriot 1600 mhz DDR3 kit
Drives: 4tb Western Digital HDD (OS Drive) and 2tb Western Digital HDD
PSU: [Original] - 550W XFX TS Series 80 PLUS BRONZE [New] - 600W Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 80+ Gold
I also have a DVD Drive, wi-fi and bluetooth PCIe card, and a system fan
  I have tried powering on with just CPU, motherboard, and RAM, but I still can't get it to POST. Sometimes, the CPU fan spins, but it is very inconsistent because I can retry a configuration and the CPU fan behaves differently. I am now beginning to suspect an issue with either my CPU or motherboard. I don't think the power outage is the cause since they happen frequently and my PC has been fine. My GPU and HDD's both power on and seem fine.
  As of writing this post, I haven't tried with just one stick of RAM. I've spent hours troubleshooting already and need to take a break. I also haven't tried with other components. I don't have any other motherboards or CPU's, so I can't. Is there anything that I overlooked, or should I get replacements?

Definitely sounds like an issue with the motherboard. The CPU fan should be turning regardless if it's plugged into the CPU fan header. Since the motherboard is ~8 years old, you can definitely try a new CMOS battery if it hasn't been replaced as it's probably dead by now and sometimes can cause some quirkiness to show up with a dead CMOS battery. However, if changing the battery still doesn't work, then the motherboard is most likely bad given it's age.

Thank you for your response. I tried a new CMOS battery (the old one was basically dead) and I got a POST with just CPU, GPU, and motherboard power. I connected everything back up and it didn't POST. I removed everything but the CPU, GPU, and motherboard power and still no POST. If I leave the power on, my GPU and CPU fans keep trying to spin, but shortly stop. Since it appears that it is a motherboard issue, would it be worth it to get a used one to replace mine, or should I just upgrade?

Honestly, buying a used motherboard on this old of a platform is just not worth the price and you would be better off upgrading the hardware. If you have a tight budget, you can go with a used AM4 and 3rd gen Ryzen.
