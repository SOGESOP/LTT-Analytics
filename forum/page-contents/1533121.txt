  What happens to electronics when they are recycled? Does someone strip copper, gold, cable sheathing from a product? is it just shredded? Id like to see a video of what electronics recycling looks like when its in progress.

 I have seen documentaries about this in the past. It has been a long time ago but I know they exist if you want to look for them. It is my understanding that there are usually contracts with ewaste companies in typically foreign (from USA perspective) countries in which they ship the parts and people there can then scrap the gold and other precious medals out of the components. The process is extremely difficult and time consuming without yielding much in return AFAIK.

 I doubt lots of people bother recycling plastic cases of products, they're usually crushed and broken down into small fragments and then fragments that have metals are separated.
  Wires are usually finely chopped and then run through air separation machines to separate plastics from metals and then the metals may be pushed further through vibrating tables to separate the metals (metals have different specific weights, so they'll separate under vibrations and water)
  Here's a couple examples of such machines
    This is somewhat custom solution, he can run chopped circuit boards through the crusher and then feed the very fine granules to be separated into categories

 Speaking of electronics recycling: I used to take some stuff to Best Buy to recycle (be sure to secure wipe your drives), but I recently took a small LCD TV there, and they wanted like $35 US. Kinda pissed because I'm sure my local dump would take it for cheaper if not free.

 I'm sure he'll store a good amount in the warehouse as resources for future videos
