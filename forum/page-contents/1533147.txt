 I am trying to host a website on TruNAS Scale, and I am having this issue, where whenever I update my IP address to Cloudflare it is my gateway IP of ISP which they share with many users. means my public IP is my ISP's public IP.
since now my gateway address is my IP which is getting shared with many users in my area, is there any way to use DyDns on any port to host a server?

Previously it used to be that you get a public IP address which might keep changing and if you keep updating it routinely with your DyDNS client you can redirect all public requests of that IP to your server. I was trying to do the same and noticed this problem.

 You cannot, you're behind Carrier Grade NAT (CG-NAT) and unless you're willing to pay for a static IPv4 address and your ISP offers this service, you cannot use DynDNS for this.

 You can run e.g. a Cloudflare tunnel to get through that. Believe Tailscale is an option too.

This. Doesn’t rely on ports being opened or a public facing IP. It just tunnels directly in. 
  But…. I also wouldn’t host a public facing website from truenas… unless it was something like nextcloud.
