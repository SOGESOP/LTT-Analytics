 So my liquid cooler's pump failed on me and as a result my cpu reached 113c before shutting down.
Brought the pc to the store(prebuild with guarrantee active),they replace the cooler with a off brand downgrade and they refuse to replace the cpu claiming it has no damage after 3 thermal shutdowns in total.
Now my question is,how do I prove 100% if the cpu has any thermal damage from those events?

 You canâ€™t.

 Three thermal-triggered shutdowns will not kill a CPU. That's the point of over-temperature protection, to shut the chip off before it cooks itself.

 There is no specific way to test that, but odds are the chip is actually fine.
  But, uhhh, they replaced a 360mm AIO with a 120?
  That's not a proper warranty fix.  Ain't no 120 AIO that'll deal properly with a 5600x.  Go tell them to put on a REAL cooler.

 The point of thermal shutdowns is to protect the CPU before it actually gets damaged. 
  They should replace the cooler with an equivalent model, a 120mm AIO in exchange for a 360mm is a joke and you should fight them on that. But you really have no grounds for demanding a new CPU, and you almost certainly don't need one.

Should've seen my athlon xp, that thing was capped at 90C for years and it still works
You'd think a CPU that's 20 years newer will be damaged by 3 (three) throttling events? nah
  Go air cooling.
