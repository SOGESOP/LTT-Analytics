 So I ordered a new ASRock 7800xt that has a recomended PSU of 800W. I currently have a 750W Gold. What are the chances I will havw to order and new PSU?

 It is hard to say because it depends on what else you have in your PC and the quality and age of the unit, but there's a decent chance you'll be fine.

 if the rest of your build is a normal one, and not like a 13900K overclocked to the moon with 1000 hard-drives you will be fine.
The recommended PSU is always way to high for normal builds because they have to take into account crazy builds as described

 As long as its a quality PSU, it should be more than fine.
