 Hi,

sorry if this is in the wrong section 

so my PC is in my office at the back of my house, My tv I want to be able to play on is in the front of the house or upstairs in my bedroom. Is there anyway I can have my pc on and able to play games on those tv's?

there is to much in-between (as in walls and just space) these rooms to have a wireless mouse, keyboard or controller to connect to it.

I CANNOT MOVE THE PC (I built a desk pc)
