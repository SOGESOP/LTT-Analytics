 I recently noticed a smell coming from my pc. Nothing burning (that I could tell) and it made my room slightly smell as well. It was a plastic smell, almost slightly sweet if that makes any sense. I swapped out PSU’s to see if that helped, which it didn’t, so I decided to take it in to a repair shop. They contacted me that they noticed no smell even after testing for a bit. What could this mean?

 probably just residue of manufacturing processes, like how new cars smell too. Just keep your room ventilated.
