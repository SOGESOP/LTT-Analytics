 Hi guys,
  This is a problem that is very widely discussed and for me hard to follow.
  The thing that i want to know is that placing your ps5 vertically or horizontally makes a big difference?
Is the liquid metal leak frequent/still occuring or is this no real problem.
  I don't really have the desk space to put the ps5 horizontal whitout it being obnoxious.
  Will i be fine?
Thanks

 I have had my PS5 vertical since the day I got it at launch and it still runs great. You shouldn't have any issues leaving it that way.

Apart from the liquid metal not covering the whole of the APU die.
