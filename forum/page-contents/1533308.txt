 I'm not sure if this is the best place for this, but here goes.
  I realize this is a tricky question.
  Please list all of the components you'd recommend for two computers - one for AMD and one for Intel.
  My thought is that you don't need a PC - you just need a device that can simulate various CPUs by mimicking the heat output (including the size). Since LonGwin and any other companies that make such devices charge an arm and a leg for a complete device, and it's liable to be massive and require more limbs to pay the shipping, that doesn't seem viable. I don't have the technical skills to engineer and build such a device, either.
  So, I'm stuck with this problem.
  I know, I know, it can't just be one CPU from each to truly be able to test all coolers. The problem is, short of being majorly sponsored and finding a team of experts to design, build and run the tests, I don't think ANYONE has another option.
  Unless you can design and build it for me.

 It depends on the CPUs you are going to test.  IF you are testing gaming performance then you need a GPU that is capable of using the CPU to its fullest extent possible. A good GPU would be a 6600 XT or a RTX 3060. If you are testing higher end cpus then you would need a 6800 XT or RTX 4070 Ti. That way the GPU doesn't bottleneck the CPU or vice versa. I hope this helps.

Is there something wrong with how the other reviewers do it?
  Or are you looking for a revolutionary way to do testing?

 Are you wanting to test CPU cooling performance?

Yes.

I've seen some who do it the wrong way, but I'm just looking for feedback on what would be the best PCs.

My intent is to test the heat dissipation coefficient of coolers. I'll run Prime 95 or similar to max out the CPU. I'll be doing this in a closed case no matter the set-up.

  Is it necessary to involve CPU? Would not some sort of hot plate with controllable heat output be easier and more accurate?

Yes but, as I wrote, I lack the skills to design and build one. Also, it would need to be able to mimic a wide range of CPUs for the most usefulness.

Ok sorry because just by reading the title its  hard to know how you are testing the cpus. also just wondering how are you heating the cpus.

No worries. Is it clear now?
