 I have the MSI A850GF, still under warranty. 
The connector at the back is having some bad contact. The cable fits firmly, but once a day / couple days my pc turns off because of it. When it happens, if I play a bit with the cable the pc will turn on without me pressing power. 
I'm not using the cable that came with it, (different outlet format, no adapters) but I have 2 cheap alternative cables. 10A, 0.75mm. It happens the same to both.
  My question: Is there anything else I should do? I really don't want to RMA since I'll probably be without my work pc for at least a couple weeks. Do I buy yet another cable? Isn't there something else I can try for the bad contact? My pc is still usable like this for now but I'm thinking this might give me trouble later, like data loss.

Something might be loose or faulty, and could be or turn dangerous.
Just RMA. Why would you want to keep something that might be faulty instead of RMA after you spent money for it.

Yeah just asking on the off chance I'm missing something.
Also the store doesn't have any in stock so if I RMA and they can't fix, they can't get me a new one. I got it for a very good price, there isn't one as good quality I can buy even if they refund the money.

Idk. (Depending on PC spec) I'd rather just use a good Tier B/C PSU than a possibly faulty Tier A. But maybe that's just me.
  Me, I'd RMA / Refund . Losing power intermittently is annoying and can be harmful.
If you want to try more, then buy a real good power cable and see if it works well. But yea if it ends up just the same, you lost money on a power cable that may or may not be useful to you down the road.

Can't say this applies to all cheap cables, but I bought and used cheap power cable (like.. $3) for my previous PSU, which was Super Flower Leadex II Gold 750w, and it was fine, no problem at all. Even when it was benchmarking GPU for a full 4 hours because I forgot about it :x
