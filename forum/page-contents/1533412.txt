 I have an Alienware 17 r5 i9 laptop which has Samsung 980 pro nvme ssd, 32gb ram, Nvidia gtx 1080 8gb graphics card and the laptop screen is 1080p 60hz. I am playing games in borderless 1080p on my 1080p 60hz tv so I am getting 60fps in games. My laptop can handle any game in 1080p 60fps.   My tv is very old so I want to buy something new. I will get a 4k screen. After that I will set the windows resolution to 4k and dpi scaling to 200% so I can artificially get 1080p without setting it. I will set my games to borderless 1080p and I will run them in https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/ so the games gets scaled to 4k.  I want to ask can my laptop run games in borderless 1080p on a 4k screen if the windows resolution is set to 4k?  The 4k screen is around 140hz but due to limitations of my laptop I can get max 120hz. Will my laptop easily get 100fps+ if I run games and even demanding games in borderless 1080p on a 4k screen if the windows resolution is set to 4k? I just want to confirm that me setting the windows resolution to 4k won't affect the game's performance because I am still playing games in borderless 1080p and maybe some extra resources are used to scale from 1080p to 4k but that's nothing.  The reason that I am worried is although my graphics card is powerful but it's not that powerful. A guy who has the same laptop as me got a 1440p screen and he set the windows resolution to 144p and he played games in ultra graphics quality in 1440p. He told me that the laptop could barely run a bunch of demanding games and he got low fps. That shouldn't happen to me because:-1) I am playing games in 1080p and not in 1440p2) I normally use high graphics quality and not ultra graphics quality

 COMMENT_BREAK I mean just set the game resolution to 1080p and bingo you are rendering the game at 1080p.  There's only a small hit to performance with upscaling which you aren't doing do you will be getting the same performance 1080p.
