 I do believe that my GPU is defective. It's not running like it should be. After running Superposition benchmark I have found out that my score with my 7900xt is on par with a 2080TI. How is that right by any means? I scored 11,700 points. I mean it runs games and works but it seems to be at much lesser performance level

 COMMENT_BREAK Background tasks, drivers up to date, CPU?Ram speed, resizeable bar.    all these things play into GPU performance. post full specs and give more info.
