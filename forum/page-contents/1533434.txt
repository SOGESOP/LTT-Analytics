Doesnt mind going a little over budget if really needed.https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/list/rXzz7R  Just want some feedback how I maybe can get a little more performance. Probably, we’re going to wait for the launch of Intel 14th gen for maybe a chance to get a 13400f for a better price

Don't need 850w at all.  Just to show it can be done near 500...

Wasn't sure he could stretch over 600, so that is a very good thing. 

 COMMENT_BREAK Guys 650W isn't enough for a 3070. Get at least a 750W and make sure its efficient. I would recommend 850W though.
