 is using 8 gb + 8gb +16bg ram Fine ?

 COMMENT_BREAK Of same speed 

 COMMENT_BREAK If you have an Intel system, then put it 2x8 in one channel and 1x16 in the other channel and check if you're getting dual channel with CPU-Z or hwinfo.

 COMMENT_BREAK Should you? I'd say no, and just get a 2x16GB kit or another 1x16GB DIMM. If you do, then just put the 2x8GB in the same channel, the 16GB in the other and it'll probably be fine. The only argument against would be if it doesn't properly run in dual channel after exceeding 16GB of RAM usage, but TBH, who cares.

This is what it says in your manual:  Quote"You may install varying memory sizes in Channel A and Channel B. The system maps the total size of the lower-sized channel for the dual-channel configuration. Any excess memory from the higher-sized channel is then mapped for single-channel operation."  But, it is likely safer to buy 2x16 (or run 4x8), so I wouldn't recommend it unless you already have a 16GB stick to hand.
