 On my old computer I never had to reset my graphics driver to play any game without it crashing. On my new computer I have to do Ctrl + Win + Shift + B to reset the driver so I can play games.   Games effected:Forza Horizon 4Need For Speed PaybackValorant Minecraft With Shaders(I don't have many games on my pc)
