Please follow this thread to keep up to date!  Please read the whole of this post before asking any questions and use the links provided at the end for help and support!    Minimum Participation Requirements For Prizes20 Days with activity*, 500,000 Points & 40 WU(*activity is defined as completing at least 1WU for the 24 hour period)These must be met DURING the five weeks of the event. Points produced before the start date do not count!    Prizes!!!(possibly more to come)Community donated prizes:    LMG Prizes?      Folding@home is a network of volunteer computers distributed around the world that aims to perform biomedical research with the single intent of helping to further understand and develop cures for a range of diseases such as; Alzheimer's, cancer, and Parkinson's. The exact research that is done is simulating the 'folding' of proteins in the body, this is important because the function of a protein id directly related to its physical shape. And this, when the protein is created in the body it needs to reshuffle its shape to get into the correct structure to perform its task. Many illnesses can be linked to faulty proteins in the body such as many cancers and neurological issues, along with a wide number of other general health concerns.   If you are wondering what exactly has been done with all this computing power then you can check out the papers written by the scientists and researchers that use the folding network, I will warn you though many of them are very in-depth reads and in turn, this means they are often fairly technical.https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/  To qualify for badges you must meet the minimum requirements for participation which for this event will be as follows minimum requirements: 500k points, 40WUs, and 20 days of activity over the course of the whole month. This is subject to change for future events as we find out what the sweet spot is to include as many people as possible but not make it too easy to just get a free badge.   PASSKEYS! (they're really important)  Don't forget to get yourself a passkey from the link below to ensure that you hit the points requirement, the passkey is a feature that was added a while ago to the Folding Client that helps to authenticate each user on the network, an added bonus of this is the fact that it allows you to qualify for QRB(Quick Return Bonus) Points, QRBs are extra points you earn for submitting work units more quickly, such as if you have faster hardware or let the client fold full time, rather than on idle. QRB credit is awarded after 10 WUs have been submitted. You can get your passkey from the link below.https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey      This is just a PSA for the new guys here, the folding team is a small close knit community, so here's a few things I'd like you all to keep in mind. It doesn't hurt to say thank you, if someone has genuinely helped you out don't forget to drop a reaction on their posts, help others where ever you can and finally we are a team first and always.   Check your stats out here! Bare in mind it can take some time for your first WUs to appear so leave it a day or two.https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/search.php  Please follow the guides below to help with set-up and troubleshooting.     

 COMMENT_BREAK Epic, can't wait for my room to be cozy for the month.

 COMMENT_BREAK Can't believe it's been another year already. Looking forward to the event!

 COMMENT_BREAK Awesome! Excited to participate in my first event!The requirements will keep my N4020 Celeron and AMD PRO AIO-8770E working hard!

 COMMENT_BREAK Event has been added to the Calendar.    I signed up, don't include me for any prizes please.

 COMMENT_BREAK Looks at UK electricity prices, starts sweating before even heating up from Folding.  I think there's a good chance the only direction I have to go in the leaderboard is down on this one.

Were reaching the point where the project is crunching the WUs faster than they have resources at their end to deal with them, which of course is both a good and bad thing.

 COMMENT_BREAK Excited to see how the flat rate electricity performs for savings.

 COMMENT_BREAK Woohoo Signed up, time to start tinkering again to find those magic PPD/clock/mem/power balances to ensure my power company isn't going to destroy my wallet...

 COMMENT_BREAK Yeeees I am in! U guys plan on using the v8 Beta or stay on v7 for the event? On my Mac imma gonna use v8 for sure, because that can do WUs that are made for Apple silicon and that way I can utilise my M1Pro. But for my windows macine idk yet...

 COMMENT_BREAK I dropped $900 on an RTX 3090. I blame y'all. And, unironically, thank you so much.  I'm currently in the middle of setting up an i7-8700 test bench/folding rig for the dual 2080 Tis that I'll explant from my current workstation that the 3090 will go in. I can't wait!

 COMMENT_BREAK My nomination for event Soundtrack

 COMMENT_BREAK I'm considering partaking, but not owning (due to not needing) a d/recent GPU, never mind more then one, how much CPU-bound tasks will find their way to @home-folders? If CPU power can be utilised, I may throw in some EPYC cores (I have 68 at my disposal, if all boards run)

 COMMENT_BREAK The build up to this month has me looking at horrible things. I could sell most of my Folding Machine, update it and consume less power. (2x 1080s, 2070, 3070 ti) for something like a 4070ti. But then I wouldn't get to look at a machine with 4 graphics cards

 COMMENT_BREAK I _MIGHT_ have just added a couple more 4070tis to the Fold. Had the boot NVMe drive fail on one of the rigs with 2 x 4070tis and BiFrost is having trouble recognizing more than 2 GPUs but I _THINK_ that's just due to using a Ryzen 3000-series CPU and it not liking the PCIe Gen 3 m.2 to PCIe3 x4 risers. Have to try a 2600x today to confirm that. Otherwise I'll have to run 3 additional Rigs rather than one.  @Mxyzptlk are you still running your Mining Frame and is it behaving with 3000 and 4000 NVidia GPUs?

 COMMENT_BREAK I've been really impressed with the 4070ti's efficiencies. Seeing as those 2-slot InnoColor3D GPUs aren't easily accessible in North America I'm running 2 rigs with 2 x Zotac Trinity OCs so there's only about 2-3mm clearance between the backplate of the lower GPU and the upper GPU but the temps are quite reasonable when clock-limited to just 2205MHz:above showing Temperature, Power, Gclock & Fan%

(P620 is a slightly higher clocked p600 with 4gb instead of 2gb)https://folding.lar.systems/gpu_ppd/brands/nvidia/folding_profile/gp107gl_quadro_p620  That's interesting as certainly on newer cards its quite a difference:  The bottom being Linux.  I admit I haven't checked the TDP on those two cards to see if there is any differences, but usually 40x0 series perform pretty much the same as they hit the voltage limit not TDP.A quick check shows the card on Linux is pulling 186W on this job but for some reason Windows is hitting 170W max and fluctuates a lot more.  Even if I stop the CPU job to make sure its not using up too much CPU it ping-pongs 172-176W.  I think it stalls for longer when hitting a checkpoint too, I wonder if thats the Windows PC using SATA SSD vs Linux on NVME?  Though that doesn't explain the lower utilisation in general.My understanding is Windows leaves more spare GPU power to prevent the UI from stuttering whereas Linux gives no Fs.    So Windows its 90-95% GPU utilisation whereas Linux sits at 98% and doesn't really move.  Even more interesting when you consider I run voltage curve optimisation on Windows but you can't on Linux.

The Inno3D card is not exactly readily available in the UK either, I think I only found one retailer who now are out of stock.

Had the boot NVMe drive fail on one of the rigs with 2 x 4070tis and BiFrost is having trouble recognizing more than 2 GPUs but I _THINK_ that's just due to using a Ryzen 3000-series CPU and it not liking the PCIe Gen 3 m.2 to PCIe3 x4 risers. Have to try a 2600x today to confirm that. Otherwise I'll have to run 3 additional Rigs rather than one.  are you still running your Mining Frame and is it behaving with 3000 and 4000 NVidia GPUs?Expand  Yes, it is running off and on with a 4070 and a 4070ti w/ no PCI riser issues that I have noticed. But I am running at full PCIe3.0x8 to each of the cards from the X99 / 5960X CPU that has 40 PCIe lanes available.   I have run plenty of 2 GPU (20XX series & 30XX series GPU's) setups on a 3000 series CPU's without an issue. But I was not running any adaptor cables, they were mounted straight to the boards.

 COMMENT_BREAK My T600 was pulling 40W + whatever power the rest of the machine it was in required, and that was for just 300k ppd. So on researched impulse, I grabbed a 4060 at Microcenter for $300. It's been doing ~4mil ppd on most projects, and that's with a 110W TDP. I wasn't set on buying another card, but it was the power efficiency that sold me. Looking at 3070's, 2080Ti's on eBay, they seem to be going for similar money, but pull a lot more power, and generally those will be with unknown history and no warranty. My 3070 does ~5mil ppd, but that's nearly twice the power draw of the 4060. Assuming you care about power efficiency, I don't think you can beat a brand new shiny 4060, unless of course you want to go higher up on the 40series line.

 COMMENT_BREAK So plan for the day:   1) Make the chat thread and invite people to the admin team  2) Get the spreadsheet made and shared  3) Reach out to @LMGcommunity for shout outs and prizes

If you must go used avoid the 2000-series, they're just not worth it. The 3000-series are about 50% more efficient that the 2000-series but don't hold a candle to the 4000-series even with their extortionate pricing which are 80-100% more efficient than the 3000-series. The 4070ti has much better efficiency (PPD/W) than the 4060(ti)/4070 but at a price premium (better Silicon likely).  The 4060 will be even more efficient if you cap it's Graphics Clock to 2205MHz or thereabouts:nvidia-smi -lgc 0,2205The Power should drop down to ~70W with only a slight decrease in PPD.

 COMMENT_BREAK I've got a question and good news.  First the question, why is my F@H lagging even when not working or when CPU is limited to less than all cores.  (2nd smaller question is that when selecting a thread count is it actually selecting the physical core count? because the F@H uses 7,5 theads when I select 4 "threads" in the configure)  And good news, seems like the thermal issues on my GPU are partially caused by the fan curve (partially by huge gap between average and hotspot temps),88% fan speed lets me use 75% power limit, instead of previous 55% and the hotspot temp stays under 80°C.

Then when it drops to a degree bellow, start WUs.

 COMMENT_BREAK So far all is going well regarding getting cards up and running. Right now I'm doing a quick test run with dual Quadro P4000s, a GTX 1080, an RTX 2070 and an RTX 2070 Super at full power, mainly to see what temps are going to be like. I didn't have some of these cards last year, so I'm not super familiar with their thermal performance and thermal output. So far I'm pretty impressed with most of the cards, but the regular RTX 2070 sounds like a jet engine in order to avoid thermal throttling. It's got a very, very cheap blower cooler on it, so I'm not surprised at all.   My next task is going to be getting a few more cards up and running. Right now I'm planning to use one of my old Dell Precision T3500s (Xeon X5675) to run two Quadro M4000s along with two Radeon RX 580s. The 580s will be running externally through PCIe risers and powered from an external PSU. It's a bit of a janky setup, but it does work, just as long as the motherboard doesn't die like last year.   Things are getting exciting again!

 COMMENT_BREAK Had units throttled up a bit ago, but it got warm.  I'll be throttling up the CPUs again probably tomorrow, and of course through the event.  Gonna give the beta a try on something too, to see how that goes.

Also we have the bathroom fan on constantly for air quality reasons and to dry the washing.

Zen 3 is quite a big leap per core and Intel has always been quite good just more limited on total core counts until more recently.  A good 12 core CPU does 1m PPD which is the same as a RTX 3050 or Tesla T4.  So if you start pushing around 100 cores, about an RTX 3080 Ti, then you'll be doing very well, just horribly on the efficiency front.
