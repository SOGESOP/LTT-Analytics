 Hi everyone,  I bought a new rig with a 13700K less than a week ago and I'm using a Cooler Master ML360 V2 ARGB.  The first time I booted the PC, the processor was hitting 100C very, very easily and thermal throttling left and right under medium to heavy load. Using any benchmarking tests (like Cine Bench) made it start thermal throttling in less than 2-3 seconds.  Since I come from a 9th gen i7 with nowhere near these temps, needless to say I panicked and I followed some tips from reddit regarding disabling the enhanced multi-core option from the BIOS and undervolting. I have done both and the temps somewhat improved, but I'm still getting 80 - 95C quite often, sometimes when only gaming (non-CPU intensive games). Processor is running on only 185W max now.  A few things I have noticed: The air coming from the AIO is not hot or even warm, it's the same as the ambient air and neither one of the hoses is warm or hot. One of the hoses vibrates quite noticeably but the other one's vibration is too subtle, to the point where I'm not sure whether the vibrations are coming from the liquid or from the rest of the fans on the case.  I have a ThermalTake Core P6 which I have removed the front and top panes so it's open-frame. The air inside it is identical to the ambient air obviously so we can very safely rule out case heat.  Please note that this is my first time using an AIO and I'm not sure if:1. What I have described above is normal (cold exhaust air, cold hoses, one hose vibration)2. The temps I'm getting on the CPU are normal  Can you please help? Thanks in advance :) 

 COMMENT_BREAK I'd try without the fans running or at low speed so you can experience heat if there is any.Remember the pump has to turn first. And it has to turn in water, turning in air won't do but this shoudn't be your issue.Also I'd consider changing the Intel ILM to a contact frame, you can find some good and cheap ones on Aliexpress.Although this won't solve your primary issue here.Edited Saturday at 10:23 PM by leclod

So I tried this and there is indeed some heat but it's barely noticeable (feels a bit warmer than the ambient air).  I am definitely considering getting the contact frame but I wanted to check if there's a quicker solution (AliExpress takes a few weeks to deliver to my country) or if I'm doing something wrong.

And there are the genuine Thermal Grizzly & Co frames that will come fast as well.  I was also thinking the contact between cpu and pump might be bad. It isn't laying flat. I'd try a repaste.Edited yesterday at 09:58 AM by leclod

Also Amazon isn't selling them where I live unfortunately.  Based on your knowledge/info, do you think what I've described regarding the AIO might mean it's faulty or malfunctioning somehow?  Also based on your responses I'm guessing that these temps I described aren't really normal for the 13700K with a 360 AIO, correct?

 COMMENT_BREAK I would try a good air cooler.

I use the Freezer i35 for the Intel 12600KF and this CPU is between 19°C and 22°C in idle when I use FreeBSD.  I never hear the CPU cooler even when I do benchmarks so I think it doesn't get very hot.  Any air cooler more powerfull than the ARCTIC i35 should be sufficient. Or do you live in a very hot country?

I know my sig says 58X3D, but I also have a 5600X and 5900X, the 5900X I run at 245w with boosts over 5GHz, which through 7nm is a real bear to cool with anything. Toms did a review of Thermalright FC140 on 13700K and they praised it. I would go with Thermalright Frost Commander or Thermalright Phantom Spirit for that CPU.

I do live in a very hot country - Egypt is practically a solar oven with ~9 months of summer.

I'll check out the ones you recommended and I'll check YouTube as well - but I guess your comment means that nothing is wrong with my setup and it's just that the AIO is pretty weak for the CPU, right?

When the fans spin at 100% it keeps a 165W CPU at 59.9°C if your room is +- 21°C.

Do you think it will be enough though considering that the 13700K can hit ~250W?

 COMMENT_BREAK Considering D15 is a 220w cooler, probably not a good plan.  Edit:  Thermalright Frost Commander 140 Review: Strong Performance, Incredible Value | Tom's Hardware (tomshardware.com)

 COMMENT_BREAK Kris is correct. Without details, we can't give correct advice.
