 COMMENT_BREAK @ascendence You gotta keep all the combined displays under 7680 x 3840. This also hinges on which version of display port or hdmi youre using, the type of displays and the display lines youre using are certified for DP or HDMI and which ever version. Non certified wires may work but its a roll of the dice. So for example 1080p, which is 1920 x1080 will equal for 4 displays: 1920 x 4= 7680    1080 x 4=4320 .... so together thats 7680 x 4320 and it will sink your 4th display. Of course thats before you get to Hz and which hookup,DP or HDMI, and whether the wires are capable or not.

 COMMENT_BREAK Are you running trying to run 1440p on all monitors for a specific purpose? Could you run one of the screens through the motherboard to take some load off the GPU?
