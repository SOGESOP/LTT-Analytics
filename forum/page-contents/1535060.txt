What do you have as a backplate on the motherboard?

Do you overclock ? What's your budget? : ) : )  BC even a budget - cheapo tower cooler with 3-4 heatpipes vastly outperforms the stock "wraith stealth" cooler with a significant margin. You need not to spend a fortune on cooler. Pretty much anything aftermarket will be an improvement over the stock.  But how do you expect to receive any meaningful recommendation without providing at least basic information on the intended use?   I don't want to sound like a jerk, but those simple insights (case, motherboard, OC or not, budget allocated to the task) are important : )

Expand  I got a gigabite a520 ds3h, I don’t overclock and I would say my budget is like maybe 40-60$ on a cooler.

 COMMENT_BREAK Unless you plan to do a very intensive CPU tasks constantly on your PC, a stock cooler or cheap coolers like the ones being recommended are more than enough.

The noctua u12s costs 100$ here in sweden but I saw a u12s redux for 60$ what’s the difference between redux and non redux?

 COMMENT_BREAK Just get a cheap single tower Thermalright if the PA120 doesnt fit. 25 bucks here for one.

 COMMENT_BREAK   1 hour ago, podkall said:what kind of temps are you getting?Like 46 on idle and 64 maybe when gaming 

 COMMENT_BREAK   1 hour ago, Eskil28 said:Oh I see so the difference is just the material Ig?yeah, i even think the redux looks much better.  but performance is really exactly the same.  i buy everything from noctua,  i don't find them expensive at all, i just never buy the expensive and imo ugly beige ones lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

 COMMENT_BREAK if you can try importing... i got this for 60 euros from some Belgian shop... (not sure about import fees tho, in eu there are none...)  its so beautiful! : D

 COMMENT_BREAK   1 hour ago, Eskil28 said:Like 46 on idle and 64 maybe when gaming that's not the coldest CPU but not the hottest either, the very highest limit the CPU can go on is 95°C  not to mention if the CPU ever starts getting close to that number, it has multiple safety features  one of the early features would only start slowing down the CPU at 80 or higher temps    1 hour ago, Eskil28 said:Oh I see so the difference is just the material Ig?they use slightly cheaper material but claim to manufacture to same high Noctua quality their customers expect

 COMMENT_BREAK Its a nice bump. I went from a 3600XT to a 5600X. Then to a 5900X.. and now back and forth between that and my 58X3D. My boy has my 5600X so that is out of the loop. Probably good for my sanity, since the 5600X I have will scale to 2100FCLK.
