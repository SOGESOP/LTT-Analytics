 yea, its basecally in the title...  im just thinking about getting a 5800X3d now instead of an full Upgrade next year.   I mean its a great CPU, but i have the feeling that my Mainboard might be past its prime now after about 5 years, so i think about a full upgrade.

 COMMENT_BREAK Id upgrade next year, the jump from DDR4 to DDR5 will last you longer and is quite noticable. And the newer gen chips pack quite a bit of punch also. I was gong to go for a small upgrade also but i bit the bullet and went for a big upgrade, cost quite a bit more but im glad i did as its much better performance and will last me much longer than a small incremental upgrade that id need to upgrade again anyway. Basically skip the middle step and save money in the long run.  (this is depending on your budget and that obviously, dont break the bank!)

 COMMENT_BREAK yea, i was thinking so as well was just tempted by the price... Ill just try to get by with my oced 5600 until next year and take a look at what in on offer by that point.
