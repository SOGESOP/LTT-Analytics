 What did you buy today?
For me, i just had a McDonald's Big mac chicken and some fries.
  EDIT: Wow, 6 and a half years, and this thread is still going, honestly i'm regretting not being that active on the forums lately.  To many years of flexing our purchases.
  EDIT 2: 9 years, WOW...

  Just reading your footer man, why not xfire the 7850 in your spare computer with the 7850 in your girlfriends computer? You could just put it back if you ever needed to use the spare pc again.

 Fan filters anybody?
Got two DEMCI 240mm filters, one for the front (case already has one but a fair amount of dust still gets past it) and one for unoccupied fan mounts in the side panel that air is being passively drawn through. Also have a single 120mm that I sit over the spare PCI brackets at the back, the graphics card seems to be pulling some dust through there.

  Exactly, but not only DayZ, but DayZRP. 
It's the same DayZ as you know it, but simply as a roleplay. And no KoS which is even better. :) 
  Just so you know, it isn't just about electronics! If you bought stuff like clothes or food/alcohol, whatever. Feel free to post this as well! :)
