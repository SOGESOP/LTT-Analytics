   QuoteMore than 18 months ago, I vowed to push all six drives to their bitter ends. I didn't do so in the name of god or country or even self-defense, either. I did it just to watch them die.  I slowly squeezed out every last drop of life with a relentless stream of writes far more demanding than anything the SSDs would face in a typical PC. To make matters worse, I exploited their suffering by chronicling the entire process online.  Today, that story draws to a close with the final chapter in the SSD Endurance Experiment. The last two survivors met their doom on the road to 2.5PB, joining four fallen comrades who expired earlier. It's time to honor the dead and reflect on what we've learned from all the carnage.  This experiment sought to find out by writing a near-constant stream of data to Corsair's Neutron GTX 240GB, Intel's 335 Series 240GB, Kingston's HyperX 3K 240GB, Samsung's 840 Series 250GB, and Samsung's 840 Pro 256GB.  All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue. Delivering on the manufacturer-guaranteed write tolerance wouldn't normally be cause for celebration, but the scale makes this achievement important. Most PC users, myself included, write no more than a few terabytes per year. Even 100TB is far more endurance than the typical consumer needs.  After receiving a black mark on its permanent record, the 840 Series sailed smoothly up to 800TB. But it suffered another spate of uncorrectable errors on the way to 900TB, and it died without warning before reaching a petabyte.   Intel's 335 Series failed much earlier, though to be fair, it pulled the trigger itself. The drive's media wear indicator ran out shortly after 700TB, signaling that the NAND's write tolerance had been exceeded. Intel doesn't have confidence in the drive at that point, so the 335 Series is designed to shift into read-only mode and then to brick itself when the power is cycled.  The reaper came for the Kingston HyperX 3K next. As with the 335 Series, the SMART data's declining life indicator foretold the drive's death and triggered messages warning that the end was nigh. The flash held up nicely through 600TB, but it suffered a boatload of failures and reallocated sectors leading up to 728TB, after which it refused to write.  The next failure occurred after the 840 Series bit the dust. Corsair's Neutron GTX was practically flawless through 1.1PB—that's petabytes—but it posted thousands of reallocated sectors and produced numerous warning messages over the following 100TB.    The SSD Endurance Experiment represents the longest test TR has ever conducted. It's been a lot of work, but the results have also been gratifying. Over the past 18 months, we've watched modern SSDs easily write far more data than most consumers will ever need. Errors didn't strike the Samsung 840 Series until after 300TB of writes, and it took over 700TB to induce the first failures. The fact that the 840 Pro exceeded 2.4PB is nothing short of amazing, even if that achievement is also kind of academic.  The important takeaway is that all of the drives wrote hundreds of terabytes without any problems. Their collective endurance is a meaningful result.        Source: http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead  This is a pretty exceptional test, seeing that most of these drives wrote hundreds of terabytes before failing, some even reaching a petabyte. Really shows how reliable SSD's actually are in today's age, as long as you go with a decent company. Only gripe is I wish they had a Crucial drive in the test, as I believe they are pretty big in the SSD game. 

 COMMENT_BREAK I agree. A crucial ssd would be a nice addition to the comparison.

 COMMENT_BREAK YES FINALLY i wanted to see how long they lasted...  now they need to start doing 3d nand drives like the 850 and the upcoming intel SSDs

 COMMENT_BREAK And everyone says newtron ssd's are bad#CORSAIR

 COMMENT_BREAK so intel basically set their limits for 100% safe data then make sure you cannot surpass that.. if thats the case cant really see an issue with that

 COMMENT_BREAK WOOO HOOO! 840 pro got up to 2.4Pb!

 COMMENT_BREAK I knew I should of just saved up for an 840 EVO :'(

 COMMENT_BREAK Should put the nail in the coffin on the SSD endurance fears you still hear about here and there.  But it would be nice if SSD makers could get their drives to wear out a little more elegantly. Intel's solution was as expected, and honestly I would rather get a consistent, controlled shutdown at 700TB than a sudden, total failure at 2PB+. Not that it really matters to most of us anyway.

 COMMENT_BREAK Nice test, but how much do I use per day is my questionDoes anybody know about an application that could monitor the data written to a specific dry from when I push the button on my pc to when I'm about to shut it down for the night ?

 COMMENT_BREAK I wonder how the endurance of NVME / NVMEHCI drives will be once they're out for consumers.  Maybe we'll hit a few exabytes

 COMMENT_BREAK It would be nice to have this done with Samsungs 3D NAND, and ADATA.

 COMMENT_BREAK After 2+ years my Kingston 3k only has 5.4TB in 14161 as an OS, that has taken some abuse. Think I'm less worried now.

 COMMENT_BREAK I doubt they're going to do it; but, it would be cool to redo this with the current generation of those SSDs now (ex Samsung 850's vs 840's). It would be interesting to see if the endurance changes.

 COMMENT_BREAK wow corsair.

 COMMENT_BREAK Absolutely brilliant, thanks that post OP. I feel that samsung pro SSD's are the best around. They do cost more upfront, but I believe they can be passed down from build to build. Although this was not a very scientific experiment. It was very informative. I wish more channels would run experiments like this. Thx again OP

I mean this experiment already took over a year, with an 850 Pro it could take the rest of the decade.

 COMMENT_BREAK So basically with normal use an SSD will outlast a HDD.

I'm sure they'll get the last of it figured out. Also, you can just re-save old data and it'll be back up to speed.

A pettabyte is 1000tb, and 1,000,000gb. You can reinstall your os everyday for the next 39 years and be fine. And that is considering that everytime you reinstall you install all the apps you use such as browsers and clients and some games that total together to 70gb writes per day. That is only considering 1 petabyte write that most of the drives exceeded by far

 COMMENT_BREAK   On 3/13/2015 at 1:39 AM, Captain Chaos said:So basically with normal use an SSD will outlast a HDD.Yeah.I've seen some enterprise HDDs rated for like more than half of PT per year workload, not sure when they'd die tho.While SSDs can last long what this thread shows good, they "burn" faster (ofc have # of cycles they can write) cause they are faster so you can burn them way quicker than HDD if you'd want to. But still while endurance of SSDs gained significant boost over time it's not there yet where you could get one and set it to endurance test and that it could last like that for 10y. But yeah, I'm pretty sure couple of years they'll be over top grade HDDs in terms of endurance for like data centers.One thing I always asked my self... how come SSDs can't be like RAM, meaning have unlimited # of reads/writes. When will we see those

 COMMENT_BREAK Seems like I'll be replacing my 850 Pro due to speeds rather than hardware failure.

But it probably won't fail due to you writing data to it; which is what so many people are irrationally afraid of when it comes to SSDs.

I believe it was 25% of drives.  I've written 55TB to mine, and it reads at 525MB/s and writes at 328MB/s.  That said, I plan to retire it from my main rig and stick it in my game server soon.

 COMMENT_BREAK   On 3/13/2015 at 3:04 PM, Sakkura said:Samsung Magician doesn't test in a way that will show the problem, even when it is affecting the drive.  Yes it does, when the drive slows down it won't magically show more speed than it can actually deliver.  Sure, the flaw may still be there, but if it doesn't result in a decrease in performance yet, it's irrelevant whether there is or not.

 COMMENT_BREAK had a conversation with a friend of my dad 2 month ago and he basically said that write/read is limited therefore ssd can't really be used on actual desktop I answered that yes they are limited but the amount of write/read is huge and cannot be reach unless you make it by purpose. Now I have the number and HOLY SHIT 2.4PB IS HUGE 

 COMMENT_BREAK How many of each model were tested?

Sure, the flaw may still be there, but if it doesn't result in a decrease in performance yet, it's irrelevant whether there is or not.  Most storage benchmarks, including Samsung Magician AFAIK, measure performance by writing and reading its own set of data to the drive. Which is generally the right way to do things, you can control whether the data is compressible or not, and so on.  But the 840 Evo issue only affects data that has been sitting on the SSD for at least a couple of months. Read speeds slow down for that data, but will recover if the data is rewritten elsewhere or if it's deleted and replaced by new data.  That's why it took a while for the issue to be discovered - first it took a few months for slowdowns to happen, then it took another several months for anyone to run non-standard benchmarks and notice something weird was going on that most benchmarks weren't seeing.

 COMMENT_BREAK Glad I bought a 840 pro as my main OS drive. Ive had it over 1 year so far only 3.22TB written so far LOL. Guess ive got a long way to go before it fails muahahah

 COMMENT_BREAK I think most people just buy a SSD for the OS, so it would be hard to reach this amount of reads/writes.

 COMMENT_BREAK And here I am using my SSD as OS-only and keeping there pretty much no games whatsoever...I guess I'll start using it more from now on, I don't think I've broken even 1TB on it yet.I guess since the price per Gb went down almost a tenfold in 5 years, it's pretty safe to assume it'll be alright to clock ~100TB per year. That's pretty much like filling my whole 256GB drive every single day.

 COMMENT_BREAK Rather than saying SSDs are inherently reliable, this just says that this particular mode of failure (flash cell wear-out) is nearly impossible to encounter. If your SSD fails, it will certainly be for a different reason.
